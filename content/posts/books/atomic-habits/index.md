# The Fundamentals

*Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference*

## Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

- The aggregation of small gains leads to large changes.
- It's easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and to underestimate the value of small improvements on a daily basis.
- We believe that massive success requires massive action. However, this isn't true.
- Improving 1% every day for one year is a gain of $$ 1.01^{365} = 37.78 $$ versus 1% worse every day is $$ 0.99^{365} = 0.03 $$.
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
- A single decision is easy to dismiss.
- Success is the product of daily habits, not one in a lifetime transformations.
- You should be more concerned about your current trajectory, not your current results.
- Habits are a double-edged sword as they can compound for you or against you.
- Examples of positive compounding
    - Productivity
    - Knowledge
    - Relationships
- Examples of negative compounding
    - Stress
    - Negative thoughts
    - Outrage
- Habits appear to make no difference until you pass a critical threshold.
- You have to persist long enough to get through the plateau of latent potential.
- Progress isn't linear but exponential.
- Success is more closely tied to systems rather than goals.
- Goals are the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.
- If you completely ignored your goals and only focused on your systems, would you still succeed?
- Goals are good for setting direction, systems are good for making progress.
- Problems with goals
    - Winners and loses have the same goal. Goals suffer from survivorship bias.
    - Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
    - Goals restrict your happiness. Fall in love with the process, not the product.
    - Goals are at odds with long-term progress. Commitment to the process will determine your progress.
- You don't rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
- Like how atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.

## Chapter 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

- Changing our habits is hard for two reasons
    1. We try to change the wrong thing.
    2. We try to change our habits the wrong way.
- This chapter focuses on the first reason.
- Three levels of change
    - *Outcomes (outer)*: changing results
    - *Processes (middle)*: changing habits and systems
    - *Identity (inner)*: changing beliefs
- Outcomes are what you get, processes are about what you do, and identity is about what you believe.
- The problem with building habits is the direction of change.
- Outcome-based habits: outcomes -> processes -> identity. The focus is on what you want to achieve.
- Identity-based habits: identity -> processes -> outcomes. The focus is on who you wish to be.
- E.g. "No thanks for the cigarette. I'm trying to quit." versus "No thanks. I'm not a smoker."
- Identity based habits are stronger.
- Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs.
- The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes a part of you identity.
- Progress requires unlearning.
- The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.
- The process of building habits is the process of becoming yourself.
- Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
- Two step process on changing your identity
    - Decide the type of person you want to be
    - Prove it to yourself through small, repeated wins
- Habits matter not because they can get you results, but because they can get you to become who you want to be.

## Chapter 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

- Learning is not repeating the same mistakes and is cutting straight to the solution.
- A habit is a behavior that's been repeated enough times to become automatic.
- Try, fail, learn, try differently.
- Useless movements fade away and useful actions get reinforced.
- Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it.
- Habits are reliable solutions to recurring problems in the environment.
- They're just a memory of the steps used to solve the problem in the past.
- The main reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict the future.
- Habits reduce cognitive load by off-putting the task to the unconscious mind.
- The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.
- Habits create freedom by freeing up mental energy for thinking and creativity.
- Four stages of building habits
    1. Cue
    2. Craving
    3. Response
    4. Reward
- The cue triggers the brain to initiate behavior.
- The craving is the change in state that we desire.
- The response is the actual habit.
- The reward is the result from the habit.
- If any of the four steps fail, then the habit isn't created.
- The four stages form a feedback loop known as the habit loop.
- The Four Laws of Behavior Change
    - How to create a good habit
        - Make it obvious.
        - Make it attractive.
        - Make it easy.
        - Make it satisfying.
    - How to break a bad habit
        - Make it invisible.
        - Make it unattractive.
        - Make it difficult.
        - Make it unsatisfying.

# The 1st Law

*Make It Obvious*

## Chapter 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right

- The brain is a prediction machine.
- You don't need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin.
- Habits are unconscious and because we aren't aware of them, behavior change starts with awareness.
- There aren't good and bad habits, only effective habits that are aimed at solving problems.
- Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good.

## Chapter 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit

- Implementation intention: how you intend to implement a particular habit.
- Time and location are two common cues.
- "I will perform [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]."
- E.g. "I will study cognitive science at 8 PM every day in my room."
- People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through with it.
- People don't lack motivation, they lack clarity.
- There isn't a need for a decision, just follow the plan.
- Being specific about what you want and how to achieve it helps prevent distractions and bad decisions.
- When your dreams are vague, it's easy to rationalize small exceptions and to put it off.
- The Diderot Effect: a domino effect occurs when one change leads to another.
- You often decide what to do next based on what you just did.
- Habit Stacking: identify a current habit and then stack a new behavior on top.
- Habit stacking is a special form of implementation intention in that rather than pairing the habit to a time and place, you pair the habit with a current one.
- "After doing [CURRENT HABIT], I will do [NEW HABIT]."
- E.g. "After reading my cognitive science textbook for one hour, I will read a different book for another hour."
- It's like a set of rules you follow or an algorithm.
- Make the habit obvious by being specific and detailed.

## Chapter 6: Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

- People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are.
- Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.
- Every habit is context dependent.
- Approximately 10 million out of 11 million sensory receptors are used for vision.
- A small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do.
- Cues that are visible and obvious make it easier to start a habit.
- To make a habit a big part of life, make its cue a big part of the environment.
- Habits aren't associated with a specific trigger but instead with a context or situation.
- The context becomes the cue.
- Build new habits with a new context.
- Avoid mixing contexts as it'll mix the habits.
- E.g. No working from home.
- Every habit should have a home.
- Habits thrive under predictable circumstances.
- A stable environment allows for stable habits.

## Chapter 7: The Secret to Self-Control

- More disciplined people don't have more willpower, they just structure their time to avoid tempting situations.
- You can break a bad habit, but you're unlikely to forget it.
- Kill bad habits by reducing exposure to the cue.

# The 2nd Law

*Make It Attractive*

## Chapter 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible

- We've gotten too good at pushing our own buttons.
- The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it's to become habit forming.
- The dopamine spike is something all habits share.
- Dopamine creates the desire but doesn't stop an experience from being pleasurable.
- Habits are dopamine driven feedback loop.
- Dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.
- It's the anticipation of a reward, not the fulfillment of it, that gets us to take action.
- Desire is the engine that drives behavior.
- Temptation bundling is when you link a habit that you want to do with a habit that you need to do.
- E.g. Riding a cycle while watching Netflix.
- "After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT]."

## Chapter 9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits

- A genius isn't born, but is educated and trained.
- Behaviors are attractive when they help us fit in.
- We imitate the habits of three groups.
    1. The close.
    2. The many.
    3. The powerful.
- We pick up habits from the people around us.
- Our friends and family provide invisible peer pressure that pulls us in their direction.
- Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want. Where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.
- It transforms your personal quest into a shared one.
- The shared identity reinforces your personal identity.
- Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide us.
- E.g. Amazon reviews
- There's evidence in numbers. However, this can be a downside.
- The reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument or finding the truth.
- Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.
- We imitate powerful people because we desire what they have.
- Survivorship bias.

## Chapter 10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits

- Every behaviour has a surface-level craving and a deeper underlying motive.
- A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive.
- New habits don't create new motives, but rather latch onto underlying motives.
- The "why" chain.
- Habits are modern day solutions to ancient desires.
- Life feels reactive, but it's actually predictive.
- The cause of your habits is the prediction that precedes them.
- A craving is the sense that something is missing.
- Emotions and feelings gives us the ability to make decisions.
- You don't "have" to do anything. You "get" to.
- Reframing a habit to highlight its benefits makes the habit more attractive.
- Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.

# The 3rd Law

*Make It Easy*

## Chapter 11: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward

- We are so focused on finding the best solution that we never take action.
- We think more because we want to avoid and delay failure.
- To master a habit, the key is repetition, not perfection.
- Repetition is a form of change. It changes the brain.
- Habits form when a behavior is repeated enough to become automatic.
- Habits form based on frequency, not time.
- The amount of time you've been performing a habit isn't as important as the number of times that you've performed it.

## Chapter 12: The Law of Least Effort

- Law of Least Effort: when deciding between two similar options, people tend to pick the one that requires the least amount of work.
- We are motivated to do what's easy.
- The less energy a habit requires, the more likely it's to occur.
- The goal isn't the habit, but what it delivers.
- Rather than try to overcome the friction in life, you reduce it.
- One way of reducing friction is to practice environment design.
- Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.
- E.g. Want to read more? Set the book on a comfy chair with a mug beside it.
- Reduce the friction associated with good habits.
- The opposite also works. Increase friction to stop bad habits.
- How can we design a world where it's easy to do what's right.

## Chapter 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule

- Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. And once you're on the highway, there's no stopping.
- Decisive moments: moments that deliver a significant impact.
- E.g. Starting your homework versus starting a video game.
- We are limited by the choices we make.
- Small choices over a day stack up that amount to significantly different days.
- Two minute rule: when you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.
- Easier habits are gateways to more challenging habits.
- A habit must be established before it can be improved.

## Chapter 14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible

- Sometimes, success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard.
- A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future.
- The best way to lock in your future behavior is to automate your habits.
- Invest in technology and onetime purchases to lock in future behavior.

# The 4th Law

*Make It Satisfying*

## Chapter 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change

- We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.
- What's immediately rewarded is repeated, what's immediately punished is avoided.
- The first three laws increase the odds of a habit being performed this time. The fourth law increases the odds of a habit being performed next time.
- The trick is that we're looking for immediate satisfaction.
- Immediate-return environment vs delayed-return environment.
- Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.
- The costs of your good habits are in the present. The cost of your bad habits are in the future.
- Delayed gratification. The last mile is the least crowded.
- Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward.
- Select rewards that reinforce your identity rather than conflict with it.
- E.g. Rewarding yourself with ice cream after working out.
- Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.

## Chapter 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day

- Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures provide clear evidence of your progress.
- Measure progress with a habit tracker.
- A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit.
- Its makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.
- Tracking a habit keeps you in check with reality and provides a satisfying visual cue on your progress.
- The most effective form of motivation is progress.
- However, habit tracking is difficult because it forces you into two habits.
- Tips to make tracking easier
    - Automate it
    - Track only important habits
    - Record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs
- "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT]."
- Don't break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.
- How to recover when your habits break down: never miss twice.
- Successful people don't dwell on their mistakes, they rebound quickly.
- Doing a poor job is better than doing no job because you maintain the habit.
- The all or nothing pitfall.
- Another pitfall from measuring a habit is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it.
- We optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.
- "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

## Chapter 17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything

- We are more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is painful.
- To add an immediate cost to any habit, create a habit contract.
- Similar to how governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can use a habit contract to hold yourself accountable.
- A habit contract is an agreement where you state your commitment to a habit and the punishment if you don't follow it.
- Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.

# Advanced Tactics

*How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great*

## Chapter 18: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t)

- The secret to maximizing your chances of success is to choose the right field of competition.
- Habits are easily to do when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities.
- Competence is highly dependent on context.
- Genes don't determine your destiny, they determine your areas of opportunity.
- "Genes can predispose, but they don't predetermine."
- You should build habits that work for your personality.
- You don't have to build the habits that everyone tells you to build.
- How do you figure out which field you're fit for? Trial and error.
- However, life is too short to try everything so instead do the explore/exploit trade-off.
- Initially explore and then exploit the solutions you've found.
- But don't stop exploring when you've found a field, just reduce the time spent exploring.
- Questions to narrow down the field
    - What feels like fun to me, but work to others.
    - What makes me lose track of time.
    - Where do I get greater returns than the average person.
    - What comes naturally to me.
- Don't forget the role of luck. Of being in the right place at the right time with the right skills and right people.
- When you can't win by being better, you can win by being different.
- Play a game that favors your strengths. If no game exists, then create one.
- Genes don't eliminate the need for hard work, they clarify what to work hard on.

## Chapter 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work

- The brain loves a challenge but only if it's in an optimal zone of difficulty.
- The Goldilocks Rule: that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right at the edge of their current abilities.
- Improvement requires a delicate balance between challenges and progress.
- Mastery requires practice, but that eventually becomes boring.
- The greatest threat to success isn't failure but boredom.
- You need just enough winning to experience satisfaction and just enough wanting to experience desire.
- When a habit is truly important, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood.
- You have to fall in love with boredom.

## Chapter 20: The Downside of Creating Good Habits

- Habits create the foundation for mastery.
- The upside of habits is that we can do them without thinking.
- The downside of habits is that we get used to doing it that way and ignore small errors.
- Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery.
- Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
- Each habit unlocks the next level of performance in an endless cycle.
- However, they also lock us into a certain way of thinking and acting.
- Avoid falling into complacency by establishing a system for reflection and review.
- Review and reflection enables long term improvement because it makes you aware of your mistakes and where to improve.
- It also enables you to view the bigger picture and to keep your identity in check.
- The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.
- If we cling to only one identity, then we become brittle if that identity is lost.
- The solution is to redefine your identity to be more general and flexible.

## Conclusion: The Secret to Results That Last

- The secret to habit change isn't a small improvement, it's the compounding of those small improvements.
- Success is achieved through commitment to tiny, sustainable, unrelenting improvement.
- It's a system of consistent improvement.
- There is no finish line, no permanent solution.
- Small habits don't add up, they compound.
