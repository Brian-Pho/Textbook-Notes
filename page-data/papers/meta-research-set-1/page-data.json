the risks in overemphasizing novelty (newness) when deciding what makes good science.</li>\n<li>Placing too much value on novelty could have counterproductive effects and it should be replaced with an emphasis on the predictive power of science.</li>\n<li>Our scientific establishments (agencies, review panels, editorial boards) are putting a higher and higher premium on research that is deemed novel.</li>\n<li>Incremental findings are relegated to publication in second- and third-tier journals.</li>\n<li>The message is clear: novelty equates with good research.</li>\n<li>Many scientists follow Popper’s idea that a hypothesis can never be proved, only disproved, with evidence.</li>\n<li>However, to be practical, scientists do allow that empirical evidence can either support or falsify a hypothesis.</li>\n<li>Popper believed that “good tests kill flawed theories” and Lakatos argued that “good research is progressive”, meaning scientists should constantly seek to expand their hypotheses into new areas of observation.</li>\n<li>Today, however, review panels are likely to tag progressive research as lacking novelty because seeking to expand old hypotheses into new realms is less valued than developing new hypotheses.</li>\n<li>This is misguided.</li>\n<li>On the flip side of Popper was Kuhn and his idea of a paradigm.</li>\n<li>While Popper advocated for abandoning a theory when it was falsified, Kuhn emphasized that paradigms can tolerate a good deal of anomalies and still remain valid.</li>\n<li>If scientists had to drop their paradigms every time they encountered a problem, then nothing would get done.</li>\n<li>Only a critical mass of anomalies requires a paradigm shift.</li>\n<li>Nothing in the ideas of Popper or Kuhn particularly values novelty for its own sake.</li>\n<li>What distribution of people across rival research programs is best for science?</li>\n<li>One solution is to distribute researchers over the widest possible range of research programs, to maximize the novelty of their own research program.</li>\n<li>One researcher, Merton, argued that recognition is the main form of reward in science.</li>\n<li>In particular, the “priority rule”, which awards the most recognition to the first investigator to support a hypothesis, is an especially powerful incentive in science.</li>\n<li>The priority rule, in a way, bakes into science the value of novelty as when too many scientists work on the same hypothesis, there’s an incentive to work on novel hypotheses because even though the chances of success might be smaller, the share of credit is greater.</li>\n<li>Competition is also important in science as it encourages investigators to check the validity of their competitors’ work.</li>\n<li>This checking, along with the priority rule, helps to maintain a balance between creativity and skepticism.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hull viewed the success of science as a result of a delicate balance between</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Competition and cooperation</li>\n<li>Creativity and skepticism</li>\n<li>Trust and doubt</li>\n<li>Open-mindedness and dogmatism</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Placing too much emphasis on novelty could upset this equilibrium in ways that aren’t optimal for scientific progress.</li>\n<li>E.g. Publishing faster to follow the priority rule, but not publishing high quality and rigorous results.</li>\n<li>A recent example of this is the reproducibility crisis where many research results couldn’t be replicated.</li>\n<li>Novel results are particularly likely to be attacked, because those who lay claims to novelty enjoy so many advantages over other scientists.</li>\n<li>This is unfortunate because as Kuhn emphasized, hypotheses must be allowed to tolerate some anomalous results before they’re discarded, otherwise the community can’t exploit the working model.</li>\n<li>Ironically, novel research programs have a very difficult time surviving when novelty is so highly valued.</li>\n<li>Perhaps our obsession with novelty is a sort of communal nostalgia for the good old days, when important foundational discoveries came fast and furious.</li>\n<li>When an area of science experiences rapid advancement over a short period of time, it may be followed by a period where discoveries are harder to come by.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Environmental circumstances, duration and structure of practice, biological attributes.</li>\n<li>If genetic factors rigidly determine maximal performance, it’s reasonable to assume that these factors can’t be influenced by practice and hence remain stable across time.</li>\n<li>Many physical and anatomical attributes are largely determined by hereditary factors.</li>\n<li>E.g. Height and facial features.</li>\n<li>In many sports, the height of elite athletes is different from the normal population.</li>\n<li>Reasoning by analogy, maybe the basic characteristics of the nervous system, such as speed of transmission and memory capacities, have genetic origins that can’t be changed through training and practice.</li>\n<li>The relation of IQ to exceptional performance is weak in many domains.</li>\n<li>E.g. Music and chess.</li>\n<li>More generally, the prediction of occupational success from psychometric tests hasn’t been very successful, with correlations around 0.2 strength.</li>\n<li>Experts are faster and more accurate than less accomplished individuals, but this superior speed doesn’t transfer to general tests of speed.</li>\n<li>Similarly, experts’ memory for representative stimuli from their domain is vastly superior to that of lesser experts, but when tested on random stimuli, the memory of experts isn’t any better than that of ordinary individuals.</li>\n<li>Although paper claims that genetic factors have little direct impact on performance, a plausible role for hereditary factors is in the developmental history of the individual.</li>\n<li>What’s the indirect role of innate talent on an individual’s development?</li>\n<li>The conviction in the importance of talent appears to be based on the insufficiency of alternative hypotheses to explain the exceptional nature of expert performance.</li>\n<li>Paper examines the assumption that with extensive experience in a domain, a maximal level of performance is automatically reached and that the period of improvement is limited in length.</li>\n<li>Does practice and experience inevitably lead to maximal performance?</li>\n<li>Mere repetition doesn’t improve performance as further improvement requires an effortful reorganization of skill.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three reasons for not improving performance</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Too many improvements to make</li>\n<li>Don’t know how to direct practice</li>\n<li>Don’t care enough about improving</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In virtually all domains, insights and knowledge are steadily accumulating and the criteria for expertise undergoes continuous change.</li>\n<li>To reach expertise, it’s sufficient to master the existing knowledge and techniques.</li>\n<li>To reach eminence, one must first achieve expertise and then surpass the achievements of already recognized experts and make innovative contributions to the domain.</li>\n<li>The belief that a sufficient amount of experience or practice leads to maximal performance appears incorrect.</li>\n<li>There’s a widespread notion that if individuals are innately talented, then they can easily and rapidly achieve an exceptional level of performance once they’ve acquired basic skills and knowledge.</li>\n<li>However, biographical material disproved this notion.</li>\n<li>E.g. Nobody has attained the level of international chess grandmaster without less than a decade of intense preparation.</li>\n<li>This “10-year rule” also applies to music, writing, science, and other domains.</li>\n<li>E.g. The average age for scientists publishing their first work was 25.2 and the average age for publishing their greatest work was 35.4.</li>\n<li>On average, more than 10 years elapsed between scientists’ and authors’ first work and their best work.</li>\n<li>Evidence from other domains further supports the claim that motivation and perseverance are necessary for attainment of eminent performance.</li>\n<li>This leads us to analyze the types of activities commonly called practice.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Characteristics of deliberate practice</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the absence of adequate feedback, efficient learning is impossible and improvement only minimal even for highly motivated subjects.</li>\n<li>Mere repetition of an activity won’t automatically lead to improvement in performance.</li>\n<li>Using efficient retrieval structures dramatically increases performance.</li>\n<li>Having an instructor organize the sequence of appropriate training tasks and monitor improvement is superior to group instruction and non-specific curriculums.</li>\n<li>As the levels of performance in a domain increased in skill and complexity, methods to teach and train individuals were developed.</li>\n<li>In all major domains, there’s been a steady accumulation of knowledge about the best methods to attain a high level of performance and the associated practice activities leading to this performance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Deliberate practice: activities that have been specifically designed to improve the current level of performance.</li>\n<li>In deliberate practice, external rewards are almost completely lacking and it isn’t inherently enjoyable.</li>\n<li>Individuals are motivated to practice because practice improves performance.</li>\n<li>We assume that the amount of time a person spends engaged in deliberate practice is monotonically/one-to-one related to that person’s acquired performance.</li>\n<li>It follows that individuals should attempt to maximize the amount of time they spend on deliberate practice to reach expert performance.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Constraints of deliberate practice</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requires time and energy</li>\n<li>Not inherently motivating</li>\n<li>Effortful and can only be sustained for a limited time each day before exhaustion</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four phases of attaining expert performance</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction to the domain</li>\n<li>Extended period of preparation</li>\n<li>Full-time commitment to improving performance</li>\n<li>Eminent performance that makes a unique and innovative contribution to their domain</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>During all four phases, the individual requires support from external sources.</li>\n<li>E.g. Parents, teachers, educational institutions.</li>\n<li>At increased levels of performance, the practice activities change and so do the criteria of evaluation.</li>\n<li>E.g. In music, children and adolescents are judged primarily on their technical proficiency, while adults are judged on their interpretation and ability to express emotions through music.</li>\n<li>The inability of many child prodigies in music to succeed as adult musicians is often attributed to difficulties in making this transition.</li>\n<li>Similar considerations may explain why child math prodigies can fail as adult mathematicians.</li>\n<li>E.g. In math, children are judged primarily on their technical proficiency such as multiplication and the mechanics of mathematics, while adults are judged on their contributions that reflect insights into the structure of mathematical problems and domains.</li>\n<li>This lack of overlap in performance between childhood and adulthood explains why some child prodigies aren’t remembered into adulthood.</li>\n<li>The criteria for eminent performance goes beyond expert mastery of the available knowledge and skills and requires an important and innovative contribution to the domain.</li>\n<li>E.g. In the arts and sciences, eminent achievements involve contributing new ideas, theories, and methods.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Resource constraint</p>\n<ul>\n<li>International-level performers often receive their first exposure to their domain between the ages of 3 and 8.</li>\n<li>This is only possible due to their parents providing early access.</li>\n<li>Parents and guardians make possible the discovery of early signs of talent and promise.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Effort constraint</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The central claim of the paper’s framework is that the level of performance an individual attains is directly related to the amount of deliberate practice.</li>\n<li>It’s necessary to maintain full attention during the entire period of deliberate practice.</li>\n<li>The limited duration of deliberate practice is the best evidence of the effort it requires.</li>\n<li>E.g.

A sample of elite music performers contained no individuals who had started later than age nine.</li>\n<li>We find that the higher the level of attained elite performance, the earlier the age of first exposure as well as the age of starting deliberate practice.</li>\n<li>We also find that the amount of weekly practice increases with age, accumulated practice, and performance.</li>\n<li>We expect that increased level of acquired skill and performance would increase the maximal level of deliberate practice that can be sustained over extended periods of time without exhaustion.</li>\n<li>When expert performers make a full-time commitment to their domain, studies show that they spend between 50 and 60 hours per week on domain-related activity, with less than half of that time (about 25 hours per week) spent on deliberate practice.</li>\n<li>The 25 hours per week is distributed across the entire week in practice session of limited duration to recover from exhaustion.</li>\n<li>Deliberate practice isn’t limited by time, but by resources.</li>\n<li>The goal isn’t to maximize the number of hours of any domain-related activity.</li>\n<li>Instead, we should identify the activities that are most likely to result in the desired achievements and spend less than four hours per day doing deliberate practice to improve performance on those activities.</li>\n<li>Paper believes that during the process of writing, scientists develop and externalize their arguments, which can be successively criticized and improved.</li>\n<li>Seen this way, writing is an extended knowledge-transformation process and not the assumed knowledge-telling approach.</li>\n<li>Eminent scientists produce a much larger number of publications than other scientists.</li>\n<li>It’s clear from the biographies of famous scientists that the time they spend thinking, mostly in the context of writing papers and books, appears to be the most relevant as well as demanding activity.</li>\n<li>E.g. Darwin, Pavlov, and Skinner adhered to a rigid daily schedule where the first major activity of each morning involved writing for a couple of hours.</li>\n<li>Most writing on articles happened before lunch with sessions limited to 1-2 hours.</li>\n<li>Almost without exception, most famous authors tend to schedule 3-4 hours of writing every morning and spend the rest of the day on walking, correspondence, napping, and other less demanding activities.</li>\n<li>The preferred time of day for deliberate activities differs across domains.</li>\n<li>E.g. Scientists and authors consistently chose to use morning for writing, and athletes prefer afternoons.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paper’s framework distinguishes between two types of elite performance</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expert: reflects the mastery of the available knowledge or current performance standards.</li>\n<li>Eminent: requires individuals to go beyond the available knowledge to produce a unique contribution to the domain, and hence by definition, isn’t directly instructable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Framework proposes that the probability of making eminent contributions is related to the amount of deliberate efforts directed toward that goal.</li>\n<li>Across many domains of expertise, a remarkably consistent pattern emerges: The best individuals start practice at earlier ages and maintain a higher level of daily practice.</li>\n<li>In virtually all domains, there’s evidence that the most important activity, such as practice, thinking, or writing, requires considerable effort and is scheduled for a fixed period during the day, usually limited to 2-4 hours a day.</li>\n<li>In the framework, it’s impossible for an individual with less accumulated practice at some age to catch up with the best individuals, who have started earlier and maintained maximal levels of deliberate practice.</li>\n<li>The individual that started later isn’t able to increase the duration of deliberate practice as they will face exhaustion and injuries.</li>\n<li>This may lead to termination of their engagement in the domain, convinced that the best performers are qualitatively different and explaining that difference as “talent”.</li>\n<li>However, the truth is that they just started earlier and had more time to practice.</li>\n<li>Once individuals have started deliberate practice, it’s virtually impossible to distinguish the role of natural ability (innate talent) from that of acquired characteristics and skill in their current level of performance.</li>\n<li>If a characteristic was purely genetic, such as talent, then it must be inheritable and manifest in the absence of any special environmental influences.</li>\n<li>It should also be possible to specify the biochemical mechanisms that control the emergence of these characteristics.</li>\n<li>E.g. Height is an excellent example of a characteristic that we know the genetic mechanism.</li>\n<li>However, evidence suggests that many physiological characteristics are the result of adaptation to a level of daily activity, with some characteristics being due to genetics.</li>\n<li>Detailed examinations of the anatomical changes resulting from intense exercise reveal that the human body is remarkably adaptable.</li>\n<li>E.g. More capillaries after a few weeks of practice and increased mitochondria.</li>\n<li>However, the faster the changes are gained, the faster they are to be lost.</li>\n<li>E.g. It only takes a few weeks to increase the number of capillaries after working out, but if you stop working out, it’ll also only take a few weeks to decrease. The same goes for heart changes that take years to develop, but also years to decay.</li>\n<li>Exceptional abilities observed in children and idiot savants are consistent with all the characteristics of acquired skills.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two findings that imply that expert performance and initial performance don’t have a common basis</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most individual differences related to levels of elite performance are due to the amount and organization of knowledge, which must have been acquired.</li>\n<li>Expert performers have acquired skills that enable them to circumvent general memory and processing limits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It’s theorized that experts acquire domain-specific memory skills that enable them to rapidly access relevant information in an extended working memory that relies on long-term memory.</li>\n<li>This acquired memory skill underlies experts’ superior ability to plan and evaluate potential sequences of actions in the domain.</li>\n<li>Mastery, in part, is the superior organization of information.</li>\n<li>The most important implication of these acquired memory skills is that they enable experts to circumvent the limited storage capacity of short-term memory, thus eliminating any restrictive influence of individual differences in this basic capacity.</li>\n<li>E.g. Expert typists look ahead in the text to be typed and if that preview is removed, then they type at speeds comparable to those of novices.</li>\n<li>The ability to anticipate future events and thus prepare actions in advance is critical in many domains of expertise.</li>\n<li>E.g. With increasing levels of expertise, tennis players can use advance cues, such as location of arms and racquet, to predict where the tennis ball will hit in the service area.</li>\n<li>The important implication of this research is that experts can circumvent any basic limits on the serial motor processes constraining a novice by using advance cues to prepare movements.</li>\n<li>In searching for immutable characteristics matching innate talent, we conclude that individuals acquire virtually all of the distinguishing characteristics of expert performers through relevant activities, except for height.</li>\n<li>The perception that a child is talented is unquestionably real, but this perception often leads to parents providing the time and money to support deliberate practice in such domains, which leads to actual skill.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Central arguments</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The perception that an individual is talented leads to the early start of deliberate practice.</li>\n<li>The individual attains an elite level of adult performance by maintaining a high level of practice.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Note that the perception of innate talents will be relatively immune to disconfirming evidence, so long as the talents are kept general and unspecified.</li>\n<li>We can think of talent to mean promise rather than objective evidence of unusual capacity.</li>\n<li>We reject any important role for innate ability, but it’s quite plausible that heritable individual differences might influence motivation, enjoyment of the activities, and the capacity to engage in hard work (deliberate practice).</li>\n<li>“High but not the highest intelligence, combined with the greatest degree of persistence, will achieve greater eminence than the highest degree of intelligence with somewhat less persistence.” - Cox (1926)</li>\n<li>People believe that because expert performance is qualitatively different from normal performance, the expert performer must be endowed with characteristics qualitatively different from those of normal adults.</li>\n<li>We agree that the performance is qualitatively different, but we deny that these differences are due to innate talent.</li>\n<li>We view elite performance as the product of a decade or more of maximal efforts to improve performance in a domain through an optimal distribution of deliberate practice.</li>\n<li>It doesn’t follow from the rejection of innate limits on acquired performance that everyone can easily attain high levels of skill.</li>\n<li>The commitment to deliberate practice distinguishes the expert performer from the vast majority of children and adults who seem to have remarkable difficulty meeting the much lower demands on practice in schools, adult education, and in physical exercise programs.</li>\n<li>There may be heritable differences that predispose individuals to engage in deliberate practice for extended periods and facilitate motivating them.</li>\n<li>We know that experts carefully schedule deliberate practice and limit its duration to avoid exhaustion and burnout.</li>\n</ul>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/papers/meta-research-set-1/#ten-simple-rules-for-structuring-papers\">Ten simple rules for structuring papers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/papers/meta-research-set-1/#three-ways-to-advance-science\">Three Ways to Advance Science</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/papers/meta-research-set-1/#neuroscience-training-for-the-21st-century\">Neuroscience Training for the 21st Century</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/papers/meta-research-set-1/#are-ideas-getting-harder-to-find\">Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/papers/meta-research-set-1/#ten-simple-rules-for-doing-your-best-research-according-to-hamming\">Ten Simple Rules for Doing Your Best Research, According to Hamming</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/papers/meta-research-set-1/#how-should-novelty-be-valued-in-science\">How should novelty be valued in science?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/papers/meta-research-set-1/#the-growing-inaccessibility-of-science\">The growing inaccessibility of science</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/papers/meta-research-set-1/#what-science-is-really-worth\">What science is really worth</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/papers/meta-research-set-1/#meta-research-tracking-the-popularity-and-outcomes-of-all-biorxiv-preprints\">Meta-Research: Tracking the popularity and outcomes of all bioRxiv preprints</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/papers/meta-research-set-1/#erroneous-analyses-of-interactions-in-neuroscience-a-problem-of-significance\">Erroneous analyses of interactions in neuroscience: a problem of significance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/papers/meta-research-set-1/#the-role-of-deliberate-practice-in-the-acquisition-of-expert-performance\">The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance</a></li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":32,"frontmatter":{"title":"Meta-Research Papers Set 1","date":"March 31, 2021","book_authors":null,"categories":["Papers"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/papers/meta-research-set-1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/books/life-lessons-from-a-brain-surgeon/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Life Lessons from a Brain Surgeon","layout":"post"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/papers/neuromorphic-set-1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Neuromorphic Papers Set 1","layout":"post"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1031357278","1878747374","3666494887"]}
