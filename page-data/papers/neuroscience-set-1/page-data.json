Morse code only means something if you know that the dots and dashes refer to letters.</li>\n<li>However, perceptual systems have no option to refer to another thing for meaning so they build information from the relations between sensory signals and actions, forming a structured internal model.</li>\n<li>Another issue with the neural coding metaphor is that it tries to fit the causal structure of the brain (dynamic, circular, distributed) into the causal structure of neural codes (atemporal, linear) which doesn’t work.</li>\n<li>The author concludes that the neural coding metaphor can’t be the basis for theories of brain function because it’s disconnected from the causal structure of the brain and it’s incompatible with the representational requirements of cognition.</li>\n<li>The activity of neurons is often said to encode properties.</li>\n<li>E.g. The firing rate of pressure sensory neurons in skin encodes the depth of the stimulus.

One can be translated into the other.</li>\n<li>Yet, animals/humans with a single functional type of cone are color blind, why? The cones encode color information so why can’t the organism see color?</li>\n<li>The answer is that if the photoreceptor’s current also depends on light intensity, then it doesn’t provide unambiguous information about wavelength in any general setting, even in the narrow sense of correspondence.</li>\n<li>This also applies to any tuning curve experiment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The proposition that the neuron encodes the experimental parameter is mainly a property of the experimental design rather than a property of the neuron (which only needs to be sensitive to the parameter).\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 777px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/5c8245252d0b8affea01913fc1d289e6/108f8/figure2-3.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 81.19999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAQCAIAAACZeshMAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAACJ0lEQVQoz21S2ZKiQBDk/79s9sWHUaEvoE8B5VZUHJBJwHV2I6bt6CiLysrsrPam54TVNM31ekXw9XgMw/B8ztm2bS+Xi7M2TRKjdSiENcY5h2J8RY231jV1HQQBYIxSKeW0rPVTmqZrdd/3u+0ONeMwrAXem2S33WJHUUQJSZLkDeaMtQuYc66Veudn8JsEnJvNhjFGCPn481EUBfKzFsbKoqjrOo7i6f/1Avf3+yosS7M0eel89A8ogmxr7el4ehP+gP/eucnzvK6qLMuUlCsVzuF1PRQ9cdXnOP4CBgPMNMbgemVRwtKyLCFEKdXf7texcyd9doevuvlFdtd1ge/jRIyZ3W639cI0IJfbuZ/uudNlnU7ddVwmOi2U3jhCyxzBSVABAP0Y79rUOcs1OzmnCZMutok+MNEsXv7M+dy2cCWK4rqu/h3Gy5GmESKkhB4Oh1XRS/bsZJ5XdY3ZVFWVF+XxeIRb2fGEsyjhGsxrugt+HQL8hbS8KKDOw5OgjFlj0dj3A85FENBYqjiW/t4PwwgZxngcxwiMsTghEHmptIcI8CAgUip0QSc8BiAxMEqYUgaxEOhIOA+11tCvtAGTtc6bWwqBIqONCCMCY6RCR600goVTog6ESmrckVCutQUzLuuBBl3BxphACjBsSvl+70MREiBEFz8gYg4k41xJ9fm5lUp5eBihCEEOEmTBQBkHGI2w9aIQXaAWOwxj3/eV0nAO7+ob0Pl1K+9vhScAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 2\"\n        title=\"Figure 2\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/5c8245252d0b8affea01913fc1d289e6/108f8/figure2-3.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/5c8245252d0b8affea01913fc1d289e6/63868/figure2-3.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/5c8245252d0b8affea01913fc1d289e6/0b533/figure2-3.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/5c8245252d0b8affea01913fc1d289e6/108f8/figure2-3.png 777w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n<li>This confusion, that a neuron’s firing rate is a function of the stimulus parameter (rather than a context-dependent correlate), underlies influential neural coding theories.</li>\n<li>To say that a neuron encodes a property of the stimuli and isn’t only sensitive to it, we have to rule out all other factors.</li>\n<li>E.g. Wavelength isn’t encoded by single cones, but by the relative activity of cones with different tunings. The relative activity doesn’t depend on light intensity nor other properties of the stimulus so we can make the stronger claim.</li>\n<li>Thus, referring to tuning curve experiments in terms of coding promotes a semantic drift, from the modest claim that a neuron is sensitive to some experimental manipulation, to a much stronger claim about the intrinsic representational content of the neuron’s activity.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another example of when the neural coding metaphor drifts from the technical sense is for sound localization.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interaural time difference (ITD): the difference in arrival times of a sound wave at the two ears.</li>\n<li>ITD is a major cue for animals to determine the location of a sound.</li>\n<li>It’s been shown that the neurons in the IC have a critical role in localizing sounds in the contralateral field.</li>\n<li>How does the activity of these neurons contributed to sound localization behavior?</li>\n<li>One way is to consider the entire pathway, to try to build a model of how neuron responses in various structures combine to produce behavior that uses the sound’s location.</li>\n<li>Another way is to ask how neurons encode sound location.</li>\n<li>However, theories that say how neurons encode sound location don’t link how the responses of a single neuron can result in the behavior observed.</li>\n<li>E.g.

We don’t have a brain circuit for chess or driving.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Neural coding theory considers the relations between observables as redundant and that they should be eliminated.</li>\n<li>In contrast, the view discussed in the paper argues that relations constitute information.</li>\n<li>One way that the nervous system might build relations is by exploiting the “invariant structure” in sensory stimuli.</li>\n<li>E.g. When a sound is produced, the left and right ears receive a delayed version from each other. This property of “delay” is an invariant structure of sound because the ears are distanced apart.</li>\n<li>The sensory world is made up of random pairs of signals that follow particular laws that the listener can identify. This identification is called the “pick-up of information”.</li>\n<li>An interesting aspect of this alternative notion of information is that the topology of the world projects to the topology of sensory laws.</li>\n<li>E.g. Two different sounds produced by a source at the same position will produce pairs of signals that share the same property (the sensory law).</li>\n<li>This can be assessed without knowing what this property corresponds to in the world.

Mouse and monkey.</li>\n<li>Krogh’s principle: for a large number of problems, there will be some animals that will be the most convenient to study.</li>\n<li>E.g. Hodgkin and Huxley used the squid to understand the mechanisms behind AP generation because it has a huge axon (~1 mm diameter).</li>\n<li>\n<p>Benefits of convergence (using only a few animal models)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rapid development of tools to study model nervous systems.</li>\n<li>Standardization of animal procedures such as housing and breeding.</li>\n<li>Reduced costs and simplicity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Certain functions are specialized in few animals which makes studying the function difficult if we ignore them as model animals.</li>\n<li>E.g. Vocal mechanisms such as language and songs.</li>\n<li>Another benefit of studying a variety of model organisms is that they may have specialized functions that we would like to have or that we can compare ourselves to.</li>\n<li>E.g. Sound localization. Studying the barn owl has revealed that the neural computation for sound localization followed almost exactly the Jeffress model, which is based on coincidence detection of excitatory inputs arriving from both ears. Yet in rodents, the problem is solved in a different way, which is based on inhibitory inputs that adjust the temporal sensitivity of coincidence-detection neurons.</li>\n<li>The comparative approach serves as an extremely powerful tool to assess the validity of universal principles.</li>\n<li>What should a scientist looking 30 years into the future do?</li>\n<li>One can, and should, think carefully and select the model system for the scientific question, rather than feel compelled to select the scientific question for the model system.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 610px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/2c100019285222c0e022a27583bb9a5a/5aae9/figure1-3.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 145.6%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 1\"\n        title=\"Figure 1\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/2c100019285222c0e022a27583bb9a5a/5aae9/figure1-3.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/2c100019285222c0e022a27583bb9a5a/63868/figure1-3.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/2c100019285222c0e022a27583bb9a5a/0b533/figure1-3.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/2c100019285222c0e022a27583bb9a5a/5aae9/figure1-3.png 610w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Big data and the industrialization of neuroscience: A safe roadmap for understanding the brain?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Three major issues</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the industrialization of neuroscience the soundest way to achieve substantial progress in knowledge about the brain?</li>\n<li>Do we have a safe “roadmap” based on scientific consensus?</li>\n<li>Do these large-scale approaches guarantee that we will reach a better understanding of the brain?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Paper emphasizes the contrast between the accelerating technological development and the relative lack of progress in conceptual and theoretical understanding in brain sciences.</li>\n<li>We may be letting technology-driven, rather than concept-driven, strategies shape the future of neuroscience.</li>\n<li>E.g.

However, memory mechanisms are no longer linked to the outer world.</li>\n<li>The distance-duration relativity suggests that space and time correspond to the same brain computations.</li>\n<li>In the lab, we often find reliable correlations between neuronal activity in various brain regions and succession of events.</li>\n<li>We don’t directly sense time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What is consciousness, and could machines have it?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The word “consciousness” conflates two different types of information-processing computations in the brain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The selection of information for global availability (C1).</li>\n<li>The self-monitoring of those computations (C2).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>C1 is synonymous with “having the information in mind” and having that information available for further processing.</li>\n<li>C2 refers to the reflexive, self-referential relationship we have where our own cognitive system is able to monitor its own processing and obtain information about itself.</li>\n<li>E.g. Body position, whether we know or perceive something, whether we just made an error.</li>\n<li>Another term to describe C2 is introspection or meta-cognition; the ability to conceive and make use of internal representations of one’s own knowledge and abilities.</li>\n<li>Paper proposes that C1 and C2 are not related, but this doesn’t mean they don’t share physical substrates.</li>\n<li>Argument is supported by empirical and conceptual evidence that the two may come apart because there can be C1 without C2 and C2 without C1.</li>\n<li>E.g. When reportable processing isn’t followed with accurate metacognition and when a self-monitoring operation unfolds without being consciously reportable.</li>\n<li>Many computations don’t involve C1 nor C2 called the unconscious or C0 or short.</li>\n<li>Cognitive neuroscience confirms that complex computations such as face/speech recognition, chess playing, and meaning extraction can all occur unconsciously in the human brain, under conditions that yield neither global reportability nor self-monitoring.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unconscious processing (C0): Where most of our intelligence lies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“We can’t be conscious of what we’re not conscious of.”</li>\n<li>We’re blind to our unconscious processes so we tend to underestimate them.</li>\n<li>E.g. Priming and subliminal stimuli.</li>\n<li>The human brain also unconsciously processes view-invariance and meaning extraction.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>C1: Global availability of relevant information</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The organization of the brain into computationally specialized subsystems is efficient, but also raises the problem of how to integrate these subsystems.</li>\n<li>Integrating all of the available evidence to converge toward a single decision is a computational requirement that must be faced by any animal or AI system.</li>\n<li>\n<p>E.g. Thirsty elephants manage to determine the location of the nearest water hole and move straight to it. Such decision-making requires</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Efficiently pooling all available sources of information.</li>\n<li>Considering the available options and selecting the best one.</li>\n<li>Sticking to this choice over time.</li>\n<li>Coordinating all internal and external processes toward the achievement of that goal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Consciousness as access to an internal global workspace.</li>\n<li>We call “conscious” the representation that wins the competition for access to this mental arena and it gets selected for global sharing and decision-making.</li>\n<li>Consciousness is therefore manifested by the temporary dominance of a thought or train of thoughts over mental processes, so that it can guide a broad variety of behaviors.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The difference between attention and C1 is that attention has some non-conscious mechanisms such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Top-down attention can be oriented toward a stimuli, amplifying its processing, and yet fail to bring it to consciousness.</li>\n<li>Bottom-up attention attention can be attracted by a flash, even if this stimulus remains unconscious.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What we call attention is a hierarchical system of sieves that operate unconsciously.</li>\n<li>Evidence for all-or-none-selection in a capacity-limited system.</li>\n<li>The brain has a conscious bottleneck and can only consciously access a single item at a time.</li>\n<li>The serial operation of consciousness is attested by phenomena such as the attentional blink and the psychological refractory period (when conscious access to a first item prevents or delays the perception of a second competing item).</li>\n<li>Evidence indicates that the conscious bottleneck is implemented by a network of neurons that is distributed throughout the cortex, but with a stronger emphasis on high-level associative areas.</li>\n<li>Ignition of this network only occurs for the conscious percept.</li>\n<li>Nonconscious stimuli may reach into deep networks but are small and short-lived, while conscious stimuli are more stable.</li>\n<li>Such meta-stability seems to be necessary for the nervous system to integrate information from a variety of modules and to broadcast that information.</li>\n<li>C1 consciousness is an elementary property that’s present in infants and animals.</li>\n<li>The prefrontal cortex appears to act as a central information sharing device and serial bottleneck in both humans and nonhuman primates.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>C2: Self-monitoring</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While C1 reflects the capacity to access external information, C2 is characterized by the ability to reflexively represent one’s self.</li>\n<li>When making a decision, humans feel more or less confident about their choice.</li>\n<li>Confidence can be defined as a sense of the probability that a decision or computation is correct.</li>\n<li>Almost anytime the brain perceives or decides, it also estimates its degree of confidence.</li>\n<li>Confidence also applies to incoming information and we can judge it against our past knowledge.</li>\n<li>AI currently lacks meta-knowledge of the reliability and limits of what has been learned.</li>\n<li>Error detection provides a clear example of self-monitoring where we know we are wrong before we even receive feedback.</li>\n<li>How can the brain make a mistake and detect it?</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two possibilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The accumulation of sensory evidence continues after a decision is made and an error is inferred whenever this new evidence points in the opposite direction.</li>\n<li>Two parallel circuits operate on the same sensory data and signal an error whenever their conclusions diverge. This is more compatible with our remarkable speed of error detection.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Human don’t just know things about the world, they also know that they know or that they don’t know.</li>\n<li>Meta-memory: humans can report feelings of knowing, confidence, and doubts on their memories.</li>\n<li>Meta-memory is thought to involve a second-order system that monitors internal signals to regulate behavior.</li>\n<li>It’s associated with prefrontal structures whose pharmacological inactivation leads to metacognitive impairment while sparing memory performance itself.</li>\n<li>Meta-memory is crucial to learning as it allows learners to develop strategies to improve memory encoding and retrieval.</li>\n<li>The human brain must also distinguish between self-generated versus externally-driven representations.</li>\n<li>E.g. Perceptions versus imaginations and memories.</li>\n<li>Infants also show evidence of C2 as they can communicate their own uncertainty to other agents such as hesitation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dissociations between C1 and C2</p>\n<ul>\n<li>C1 and C2 are largely orthogonal (double dissociation) and complementary dimensions of consciousness.</li>\n<li>Self-monitoring can exist for unreported stimuli (C2 without C1).</li>\n<li>E.g. Automatic typing. Subjects slow down after a typing mistake even when they fail to consciously notice the error.</li>\n<li>Consciously reportable contents sometimes fail to be accompanied with an adequate sense of confidence (C1 without C2).</li>\n<li>E.g. When retrieving a memory, sometimes it comes without any accurate evaluation of its confidence, leading to false memories.</li>\n<li>C1 and C2 can also work together but this requires a single common currency for confidence across different modules.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Endowing machines with C1 and C2</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Endowing machines with global information availability (C1) would allow different modules to share information and collaborate to solve problems.</li>\n<li>E.g. Letting the rest of the car know that it’s low on gas could mean reducing gas consumption and speed.</li>\n<li>Old “black-board” systems used to try to model this aspect of cognition.</li>\n<li>To make optimal use of global information, a machine should also have a database of its own capacities and limits (C2) such as a self-monitoring system.</li>\n<li>An important element of C2 that’s received little attention is reality monitoring.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Paper argues that a machine endowed with C1 and C2 would behave as though it were conscious.</li>\n<li>E.g. It would know that it’s seeing something, would express confidence in it, would report it to others, could suffer hallucinations when its monitoring mechanisms break down, and may even experience the same perceptual illusions that we experience.</li>\n<li>Some readers may be unsatisfied with the way the paper “over-intellectualizes” consciousness and leaves aside the experiential component of consciousness.</li>\n<li>Does subjective experience escape a computational definition?</li>\n<li>In humans, the loss of both C1 and C2 covaries with a loss of subjective experience.</li>\n<li>E.g. Damage to the primary visual cortex may lead to a condition called “blindsight” where patients report being blind in the affected visual field. Patients can localize visual stimuli in their blind field but can’t report them (C1), nor can they assess their likelihood of success (C2) as they believe they are merely “guessing.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-unsolved-problems-of-neuroscience\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-unsolved-problems-of-neuroscience\" aria-label=\"the unsolved problems of neuroscience permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4574630/\">The unsolved problems of neuroscience</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Problems that are solved, or soon will be</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do single neurons compute?</li>\n<li>What is the connectome of a small nervous system, like that of C. elegans (300 neurons)?</li>\n<li>How can we image a live brain of 100,000 neurons at cellular and millisecond resolution?</li>\n<li>How does sensory transduction work?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Problems that we should be able to solve in the next 50 years</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do circuits of neurons compute?</li>\n<li>What is the complete connectome of the mouse brain (70,000,000 neurons)?</li>\n<li>How can we image a live mouse brain at cellular and millisecond resolution?</li>\n<li>What causes psychiatric and neurological illness?</li>\n<li>How do learning and memory work?</li>\n<li>Why do we sleep and dream?</li>\n<li>How do we make decisions?</li>\n<li>How does the brain represent abstract ideas?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Problems that we should be able to solve, but who knows when</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How does the mouse brain compute?</li>\n<li>What is the complete connectome of the human brain (80,000,000,000 neurons)?</li>\n<li>How can we image a live human brain at cellular and millisecond resolution?</li>\n<li>How could we cure psychiatric and neurological diseases?</li>\n<li>How could we make everybody’s brain function best?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Problems we may never solve</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How does the human brain compute?</li>\n<li>How can cognition be so flexible and generative?</li>\n<li>How and why does conscious experience arise?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Meta-questions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What counts as an explanation of how the brain works?

It feels like something to perform echolocation.</li>\n<li>We can even ignore bats and only consider humans.</li>\n<li>E.g. The subjective experience of a deaf or blind person isn’t accessible to us, nor the other way around.</li>\n<li>Such an understanding, beyond the level of language that is direct experience, may be permanently denied to us by the limits of our nature.</li>\n<li>From this, one might also believe that there are facts which couldn’t ever be represented or comprehended by human beings because our structure doesn’t allow us to operate with concepts of the requisite type.</li>\n<li>E.g. We can’t see ultraviolet light because the eye doesn’t capture ultraviolet light.</li>\n<li>The bat thought experiment suggests that there are facts that aren’t expressible in the human language.</li>\n<li>We can recognize the existence of such facts without being able to state or comprehend them.</li>\n<li>E.g. We know that people see red but we can’t state what it’s like to be seeing red.</li>\n<li>There’s a sense that phenomenological facts can be objective, in the case when the perceiver is sufficiently similar to the describer.</li>\n<li>E.g. Humans mostly have the same range of color vision so we can categorize them into red, green, blue, etc. which are objective.</li>\n<li>However, the more different from oneself the other perceiver is, the less success one can expect.</li>\n<li>If the facts of experience, what it’s like for the experiencing organism, are only accessible from one point of view, then it’s a mystery how the true character of experiences could be revealed in the physical operation of that organism.</li>\n<li>The physical operation of that organism, biology, is a domain of objective facts, the kind that can only be observed and understood from many points of view and by individuals with differing perceptual systems.</li>\n<li>There are no obstacles in describing an experience in neurophysiology.</li>\n<li>It may be more accurate to think of objectivity as a direction in which understanding can travel.</li>\n<li>E.g. The objectivity of “red” is less than the objectivity of “atom” because atom is further removed from a human viewpoint.</li>\n<li>It’s difficult to understand what could be meant by an objective description of an experience, since that removes the viewer from the experience.</li>\n<li>After all, what would be left of what it was like to be a bat if one removed the viewpoint of the bat?</li>\n<li>We appear to face a problem with psychophysical reduction.</li>\n<li>In other areas of science, the reduction of phenomena is a move in the direction of greater objectivity; towards a more accurate view of the real nature of things.</li>\n<li>This is done by reducing our dependence on individual points of view toward the object of investigation.</li>\n<li>We describe the phenomenon not in terms of its impression on our sense, but in terms of its more general effects and properties other than the human senses.</li>\n<li>E.g. To describe the phenomenon of “matter” means to go beyond our human senses into the atomic or sub-atomic realms of reality.</li>\n<li>Experience itself, however, doesn’t seem to fit this pattern.</li>\n<li>If subjective experience is only fully comprehensible from one point of view, then any shift to greater objectivity, meaning less attachment to a specific viewpoint, doesn’t take us nearer to the real nature of consciousness, it just takes us further away.</li>\n<li>Different species may both understand the same physical events in objective terms, but this doesn’t require them to understand the subjective experience of those events to the senses of another species.</li>\n<li>The reduction can only succeed if the species-specific viewpoint is left out from what is to be reduced.</li>\n<li>If we desire that a physical theory of mind must also account for the subjective character of experience, we must admit that we don’t know how to do so.</li>\n<li>Indeed, this appears as a contradiction, to objectify the subjective.</li>\n<li>The state of physicalism is similar to if a pre-Socratic philosopher said “matter is energy” because we don’t have an idea of how “what it is like to be a bat” might be true.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-baseball-outfielders-determine-where-to-run-to-catch-fly-balls\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a

image relative to the background.</li>\n<li>Outfielder: the players in a baseball game that catch the ball.</li>\n<li>In theory, outfielders could derive the destination of the ball from an assumed parabolic trajectory, but research shows that observers are very poor at using such a purely computational approach.</li>\n<li>Also, air resistance, ball spin, and wind can cause trajectories to deviate from a parabolic curve.</li>\n<li>One hypothesis is that outfielders run along a path that simultaneously maintains horizontal alignment with the ball and maintains a constant change in the tangent of the vertical optical angle of the ball.</li>\n<li>In other words, the fielder can arrive at the correct destination by selecting a running path that keeps optical ball speed constant, achieving optical acceleration cancellation (OAC).</li>\n<li>OAC works even if the trajectory isn’t parabolic because it couples the fielder’s motion with that of the ball.\n<span\n

elegant but flawed because OAC solutions require the precise ability to discriminate accelerations, and evidence shows that people are poor at such tasks.</li>\n<li>Another issue is that OAC was tested on balls hit directly towards the outfielder and without sideways motion.</li>\n<li>However, outfielders consider balls hit directly at them to be harder to catch, not easier.</li>\n<li>From this, it seems that outfielders use their vantage outside the plane of the ball trajectory in a way that simplifies, rather than complicates, determination of ball destination.</li>\n<li>An alternative explanation is the linear optical trajectory (LOT).</li>\n<li>LOT proposes that the outfielder selects a running path that maintains linear optical trajectory for the ball relative to the home plate and background.</li>\n<li>The solution is based on maintaining a balance between vertical and horizontal optical angular change and requires no knowledge of distance to the ball or home plate.</li>\n<li>In LOT, the outfielder doesn’t allow the ball to curve optically toward the ground and requires them to continuously move more directly under the ball, guaranteeing travel to the correct destination to catch it.</li>\n<li>The LOT strategy discerns optical acceleration as optical curvature, a feature that observers are very good at discriminating.\n<span\n

linear optical ball trajectory.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In the paper’s experiments, the balls launched directly toward the fielder are a special case and requires a different strategy other than OAC and LOT.</li>\n<li>The results support the premise that outfielders use spatial, rather than just temporal, cues to initially guide them toward the ball destination point.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other cases where the optical angle to a target is maintained</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Airplane pilots use spatial error-nulling to anticipate and maintain constant angular position relative to a target.</li>\n<li>Predators and organisms pursing mates commonly adjust their position to maintain control of relative angle of motion between the pair.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Findings suggest that baseball players use a similar spatial strategy.</li>\n<li>Once an outfielder establishes a LOT solution, they know they control the situation and that they will catch the ball, but they don’t know when.</li>\n<li>This explains why outfielders run into walls chasing uncatchable ball and why they don’t rush ahead to the ball’s destination point, choosing instead to catch the ball while running.</li>\n<li>LOT also explains why balls hit to the side are easier to catch as fielders can use their strong ability to discriminate curvature rather than resorting to their weak ability to discriminate acceleration.</li>\n<li>In short, the LOT strategy provides a simple and effective way to pursue and catch a target traveling with approximate parabolic motion in 3D

A frog will starve to death surrounded by food if the food isn’t moving.</li>\n<li>A frog’s choice of food is only determined by size and movement.</li>\n<li>Frog retina’s have 1 million receptors, 2.5-3.5 million connecting neurons, and half a million ganglion cells.</li>\n<li>A ganglion cell receives information from thousands of receptors.</li>\n<li>Clearly, such an arrangement wouldn’t allow for good resolution if the retina maps an image in terms of light intensity point-by-point.</li>\n<li>The amount of overlap of adjacent ganglion cells is enormous.</li>\n<li>Review of receptive fields (OFF, ON, ON-OFF).</li>\n<li>For all three types of receptive fields, the sensitivity is greatest at the center of each field.</li>\n<li>An ON-OFF cell seems to be measuring inequality of illumination within its receptive field and is sensitive to movement within the field.</li>\n<li>The optic nerve looks at the image on the retina through three distributed channels (three receptive fields).</li>\n<li>In any channel, the overlap of individual receptive fields is very great.</li>\n<li>\n<p>So the retina tells the brain that for any visual event</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The OFF channel tells how much dimming of light has occurred and where.</li>\n<li>The ON-OFF channel tells where the boundaries of lighted areas are moving.</li>\n<li>The ON channel tells where brightening has occurred.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>To an unchanging visual pattern, the optic nerve should be fairly silent after an initial burst to communicate the visual pattern.</li>\n<li>The resolution of the OFF and ON channels is about the size of a receptive field, meaning the resolution is blurry.</li>\n<li>What if the eye isn’t just making a copy of the image but instead is devoted to detecting certain patterns of light and their changes?</li>\n<li>In this case, using small spots of light on the retina may be true and yet misleading.</li>\n<li>E.g. A small spot of light not only includes intensity, but also the edge shape, size, curvature, and contrast.</li>\n<li>This paper uses a wide variety of visual stimuli to tease out the purpose of the retina and optic nerve, instead of just light spots.</li>\n<li>The authors found four separate operations on the image in the frog’s eye and each operation’s result is transmitted by a particular group of fibers.</li>\n<li>They’re also all nearly independent of the general illumination.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four operations</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sustained contrast detection</li>\n<li>Net convexity detection</li>\n<li>Moving edge detection</li>\n<li>Net dimming detection</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The first two are communicated on unmyelinated fibers and the last two are communicated on myelinated fibers.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sustained contrast detectors</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Same as ON receptive fields</li>\n<li>If the sharp edge of an object (either lighter or darker than the background) moves into its field and stops, it spikes and continues spiking, regardless of the shape and size of the edge.</li>\n<li>In some fibers of this group, a contrast previously within the field is “remembered” after the light is turned off, as it will keep a low mutter of activity that isn’t present compared to if no contrast was there before.</li>\n<li>This isn’t because this group is very sensitive, as showing an edge in darkness doesn’t trigger this residual mutter.</li>\n<li>The authors were struck by the smallness of the resulting change as in very dim light, we still get the same response.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Net convexity detectors</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To the authors, this group contains the most remarkable elements in the optic nerve.</li>\n<li>This group responds to a small object passing through the field and only responds as long as the object is in the field.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Moving-edge detectors</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Same as ON-OFF receptive fields.</li>\n<li>Responds to any distinguishable edge moving through its receptive field.</li>\n<li>It responds only to a moving edge, not a stationary edge.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Net dimming detectors</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Same as OFF receptive fields.</li>\n<li>The fastest conducting detectors.</li>\n<li>Darkening of a spot produces less response when it’s in the periphery of the field than when it’s at the center.</li>\n<li>The sensitivity of the OFF discharge to illumination increases with time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Lastly, there’s a small group of afferent fibers that don’t seem to have distinct receptive fields.

Contrast detectors are at the top, under are the convexity, next are the moving-edge, and deepest are the dimming detectors.</li>\n<li>If the optic nerve is cut in the frog, the fibers grow back to the regions where they originally terminated in mapping the retina.</li>\n<li>The restoration of the four layers also had no errors or mixing.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Implications of the paper</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shows that the eye speaks to the brain in a highly organized language and some of the signals are already interpreted by the retina.</li>\n<li>Consider the dendrite of a neuron that extends up through all four layers. Then it’s looking at a point in the image on the retina, but in terms of the properties of its neighborhood as defined by the four operations.</li>\n<li>By transforming the image from a space of simple discrete points to a congruent space where each equivalent point is described by the intersection of particular qualities in its neighborhood, we can then give the image in terms of combinations of those qualities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The output from a frog retina is a set of four operations independent of general illumination</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Local sharp edges and contrast.</li>\n<li>Curvature of edge of a dark object.</li>\n<li>Movement of edges.</li>\n<li>Local dimming produced by movement or rapid general darkening.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Matching these four operations are four layers in the brain.</li>\n<li>So what does each fiber in the optic nerve measure?</li>\n<li>Each fiber measures how much of a particular quality is in the stimulus.</li>\n<li>The operations are more like perception than that of sensation in that they are complex abstractions from the visual image and not the raw image.</li>\n<li>It seems that the four operations are built to detect a moving bug, which makes sense since that’s the source of food for the frog.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"functions-of-consciousness\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#functions-of-consciousness\" aria-label=\"functions of consciousness permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/wybkp\">Functions of Consciousness</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>While common sense suggests that conscious experience has many important functional roles in our lives, experiments and theoretical arguments challenge these everyday intuitions.</li>\n<li>Many human behaviors can occur in the absence of consciousness, and the world contains many creatures capable of engaging in complex behavior without being conscious.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Even though we evolved eyes for hunting, we now use them for reading or looking at screens.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not all present-day biological features exist as a result of natural selection; they may be due to random chance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g.

Not all conscious thinking is rational, and not all rational behavior is conscious.</li>\n<li>This dissociation between rational thinking and acting is strikingly shown in cases where subjects provide false (confabulatory) rationalizations for the cause of their actions.</li>\n<li>E.g. Split-brain patients.</li>\n<li>It’s often the result of a reasoning process, rather than the reasoning process itself, that shows up in conscious thought.</li>\n<li>This is probably not the function of consciousness as there’s a lot of evidence against it, such as the book ‘Predictably Irrational’.</li>\n<li>Damasio suggests that consciousness aids rational decision making by biasing decisions into certain ways to reduce the space of possibilities and the time and effort required to decide.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A recurring theme in theories of consciousness is that consciousness serves to integrate independent neural and cognitive processes.</li>\n<li>E.g. Global workspace theory (GWT) and integrated information theory (IIT).</li>\n<li>\n<p>GWT</p>\n<ul>\n<li>According to GWT, the primary function of consciousness is to provide behavioral flexibility.</li>\n<li>The GWT architecture allows an organism to rely more on mental simulation and on internal evaluation to select actions, reducing both energy use and risk.</li>\n<li>GWT also argues that by using mental simulations, GWT participates in an evolutionary trend towards increasing internalization of environmental representations that provides the advantage of freeing the organism from its immediate environment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Many behavioral observations have found that during the initial phases of learning a new skill, it requires conscious attention. But as learning progresses, the execution of the skill becomes increasingly automatic.</li>\n<li>This is consistent with fMRI results that showed a shift from widespread cortical involvement to predominantly subcortical activation in later learning phases.</li>\n<li>Another theory, the supramodular interaction theory, argues that the function of consciousness is to mediate interactive processing across subsystems to allow the organism to produce a single, adaptive, motor action.</li>\n<li>E.g. Some processes are consciously impenetrable, such as pupillary reflexes, heart rate, and peristalsis (intestinal muscle movement), while other processes are consciously penetrable, such as inhaling, coughing, and swallowing.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other possible functions of consciousness</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To detect and correct prediction errors.</li>\n<li>To infer the mental contents of others and thus improve social interactions.</li>\n<li>To simulate the consequences of actions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"thinking-about-the-brain\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#thinking-about-the-brain\" aria-label=\"thinking about the brain permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24965297\">Thinking about the Brain</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When approaching a new discipline, it’s useful to separate the topics that appear to be capable of explanation from those that don’t.</li>\n<li>Neuroanatomy, neuropharmacology, and neurophysiology fall under the first class, while perception, emotion, and consciousness fall under the second class.</li>\n<li>Curiously, the problem of building a visual picture requires little effort on our part compared to other mental tasks such as learning math.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Review of the brain and computer analogy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Computer is fast and serial, brain is slow and parallel.</li>\n<li>Computer is reliable but susceptible to damage, brain is unreliable but tolerant to damage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The physical layout of neurons in the brain isn’t particularly neat.</li>\n<li>E.g.

image?</li>\n<li>Recognition feels instantaneous but measuring it experimentally has proven difficult because reaction times include the time needed for response execution.</li>\n<li>However, event-related potentials (ERPs) can sometimes reveals signs of neural processing before the motor output.</li>\n<li>The experimental task is to decide whether a photograph, flashed for just 20 ms, has an animal.</li>\n<li>Essentially, it’s a go/no-go categorization task.</li>\n<li>ERP analysis shows that frontal negativity appears roughly 150 ms after stimulus onset.</li>\n<li>So, visual processing needs at most 150 ms to perform this highly demanding task.</li>\n<li>The color photographs include a wide range of animals (mammals, birds, reptiles, fish) in their natural environment and the rest of the photographs have distractors like mountains, flowers, and fruit.</li>\n<li>The average proportion of correct responses was 94%.</li>\n<li>The range of reaction times on ‘go’ trials was from 382 ms to 567 ms, with median of 445 ms.</li>\n<li>This remarkable level of performance was possible despite the very brief presentations, which rules out the use of eye movements during image processing.</li>\n<li>The go/no-go trials diverge sharply at around 150 ms after stimulus onset.</li>\n<li>The effect was clear at frontal recording sites and was characterized by a near linear increase in the voltage difference over the following 50 ms or so, with the potential being more negative on no-go trials.</li>\n<li>There was no correlation between behavioral reaction time and the onset latency for the different responses.</li>\n<li>There was a correlation between median reaction time and percentage correct, showing a speed-accuracy tradeoff.</li>\n<li>What produces the early differential activity?</li>\n<li>Presumably, the difference must be related to some sort of decision-related activation that occurs only after the necessary visual processing is done.</li>\n<li>The most plausible explanation is that the difference isn’t generated by ‘go’-related neural activity, but rather by neural activity that is specifically generated on ‘no-go’ trials.</li>\n<li>The presence of ‘no-go’ activity at frontal recording sites at 150 ms implies that a lot of visual processing must’ve been completed before this time.</li>\n<li>While it’s relatively easy to detect if an animal is present, such as seeing eyes or feathers, having ‘no-go’ activity implies that the visual system has already performed enough processing to conclude that no animal is present anywhere in the image.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"spike-arrival-times-a-highly-efficient-coding-scheme-for-neural-networks\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a

networks</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The speed that visual processing occurs at in the human brain puts heavy constraints on the way information is processed.</li>\n<li>Given that visual processing is so fast, the only way it can be achieved is by using a single feed-forward pass through the visual system.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paper’s argument</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Neurophysiological data shows that neurons in the temporal cortex have latencies around 100-140 ms.</li>\n<li>Anatomically, there appear to be at least 10 synaptic stages between the photoreceptors of the retina and the visually responsive neurons in the temporal lobe (2 in retina, 1 in LGN, 2 each in V1, V2, and V3, and 1 in IT cortex).</li>\n<li>Since the 10 synaptic layers must be crossed in 100 ms, this implies the each layer has only an average of 10 ms of processing time.</li>\n<li>Given that the firing rates of cortical neurons are in the range of 0 to 100 spikes per second, it follows that neurons in any given layer can only generate 1-2 spikes before neurons in the next layer have to respond.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This puts major constraints on the way information is encoded.</li>\n<li>E.g. It’s unreasonable to propose that firing rate can be used as an accurate code because that would take too long (since neurons would need multiple spikes to determine the rate).</li>\n<li>One possibility is that with two spikes, one can use the interval between them as a code.</li>\n<li>E.g. The closer the spikes, the stronger the activation.</li>\n<li>However, evidence indicates that a large amount of information can be transferred using only one spike per neuron.</li>\n<li>Author proposes a new way of coding information in neural networks; that information is encoded by the relative arrival time of spikes.</li>\n<li>It’ll also be shown how such a scheme allows for very rapid resolution of the classic “Winner-takes-all” problem.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spike arrival time hypothesis</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s known that the time taken for a neuron to reach its threshold for generating a spike depends on the strength of the stimulus.</li>\n<li>E.g. The stronger the stimulus, the faster the depolarization, and the sooner the spike.</li>\n<li>Imagine what happens when an image is flashed onto the retina.</li>\n<li>If the cells in the retina are sensitive to local intensity, a wave of spikes will be generated in the optic nerve, with the leading spikes corresponding to the points on the retina where the intensity is highest.</li>\n<li>As a result, even if each retinal cell generated only one AP, the complete intensity distribution of the image could be coded by the relative timing of spikes in the different fibers of the optic nerve.</li>\n<li>This isn’t biologically realistic, as retinal ganglion cells don’t simply code the local intensity, but rather local contrast.</li>\n<li>Nevertheless, the argument is the same.</li>\n<li>However, for this encoding to be useful, the next processing layer must make use of such information.</li>\n<li>It could use synaptic veto mechanisms where if a spike from one input arrives before another, then it could block the transmission of the second spike.</li>\n<li>It’s also known that the auditory system is sensitive to the relative arrival times of APs in determining spatial location.</li>\n<li>The differences in spike arrival time are due to timing differences in the arrival times of the actual physical stimuli.</li>\n<li>What’s being proposed here is that the nervous system could make use of differences in spike arrival times resulting not from temporal differences in the stimulus itself, but rather the delays introduced by the coding.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Problem of continuous input</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A briefly flashed image onto the retina isn’t the same as a continuously changing input.</li>\n<li>Maybe eye movements (saccades) synchronize APs coming from the retina, or maybe there’s some other synchronization mechanism in the brain.</li>\n<li>Personally, I believe the brain handles it asynchronously.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applying to the “Winner-Takes-All” problem</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suppose we have an array of inputs of varying levels of activity and we want to select only the most active one.</li>\n<li>One way is to introduce inhibition so that the most active unit inhibits all others.</li>\n<li>However, this requires a lot of iterations which will take time.</li>\n<li>If we use relative spike arrival time, we can solve this problem using just one inhibitory neuron.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block;

comparable to the chimpanzee.</li>\n<li>During evolution, dolphins may have increased the computational performance of their ‘simple’ neocortex by the multiplication of relevant structures (increasing surface area), instead of increasing its complexity.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paper suggests that the evolution of the large dolphin brain was due to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using sonar as a successful feeding strategy to support the increased metabolism of a larger brain.</li>\n<li>The pelvic girdle not limiting brain size at birth.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Particularly impressive for the dolphin brain is the size and gyrification of the neocortex, with a surface area surpassing that of human brains.</li>\n<li>The sound generator and auditory system of a dolphin may have been the primary factor for the evolutionary size increase of the brain.</li>\n<li>Auditory structures in the dolphin’s brain are generally large (analogous to our large visual structures).</li>\n<li>It’s speculated that the hypertrophy (enlargement/overgrowth) of the dolphin brain resulted from the animal’s need for greater precision and speed in processing sound, due to the increased speed of sound in water compared to air.</li>\n<li>This hypertrophy correlates with the large diameter of the auditory nerve fibers, the short latency in auditory brainstem responses, and the rapid temporal resolution of successive sounds.</li>\n<li>In dolphins, the need for great precision and speed in processing sound, the highly cognitive capabilities, the hypertrophic cerebrum, and the extended gyrification of the cerebrum seem to be in paradoxical contrast to the thin neocortical plate.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dolphin neocortical grey matter is characterized by</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The absence of layer IV</li>\n<li>Poor granulation with the predominance of large isodendritic stellate cells</li>\n<li>Well developed layers I and VI</li>\n<li>An accentuated layer II</li>\n<li>A high number of pyramidal neurons in layers II and VI</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These characteristics seem to represent a primitive mammalian brain.</li>\n<li>Although neuron density is low in the dolphin neocortex, synaptic density is high and the absolute number of synapses is similar to that in humans.</li>\n<li>The total number of neurons in the neocortex of the bottlenose dolphin and the false killer whale is similar to the chimpanzee.</li>\n<li>It’s possible that the high absolute number of neurons and the high number of synapses in dolphins contributes to their strong cognitive capabilities.</li>\n<li>The ability to perform precise and fast sound processing and the highly cognitive capabilities may be possible due to the expansion of the neocortex, instead of the development of a more complex one.</li>\n<li>This was probably a neurobiological alternative to the situation in primates.</li>\n<li>The size of the dolphin brain doesn’t seem to be in paradoxical contrast to the ‘simple’ neocortical architecture but

To predict the next sensory input, a patch of neocortex must know where a sensor will be on the object after a movement is completed.</li>\n<li>And this location prediction must be done on a sensor-by-sensor basis because each sensor will feel a different location and feature.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theoretical requirements for a generated location signal</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To translate an egocentric motor signal into a predicted allocentric location, a column must also know the orientation of the object relative to the body part doing the moving.</li>\n<li>Current location + Orientation of object + Movement >= Predicted new location</li>\n<li>While this is a complicated task, grid cells show that it’s possible for neurons to perform.</li>\n<li>Grid cells use the current location, head direction cells, and movement to predict a new location.</li>\n<li>This is same information that’s needed to predict a location.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These analogs, plus the fact that grid cells are evolutionarily older than the neocortex, leads us to hypothesize that this mechanism was preserved and replicated in the sub-granular layers of each cortical column.</li>\n<li>While we don’t have direct evidence that each cortical column has grid-cell like functionality, we do know that numerous cortical areas are modulated by body movement and position.</li>\n<li>In this model, inhibition plays a role in that mini-columns mutually inhibit each other.</li>\n<li>Cells that spike first prevent other nearby cells from firing, and this requires a very fast, winner-take-all type of inhibition among nearby cells.</li>\n<li>Traditionally, it’s been assumed that as sensory input ascends the sensory processing hierarchy, cells respond to larger areas (receptive fields) and to more complex features.</li>\n<li>This assumes that complete objects can only be recognized at the top of the hierarchy where cells respond over the entire sensory array.</li>\n<li>The model presented here, however, proposes that all cortical columns are capable of learning representations of complete objects.</li>\n<li>Hierarchy is still incorporated into the model as larger stimuli that covers many receptive fields still requires converging input onto a higher cortical region to recognize.</li>\n<li>Thus, the cortex learns multiple models of objects, both within a region and across hierarchical levels.</li>\n<li>This model also fits more into the ‘what’ visual pathway for object recognition and it’s unsure how it fits into the ‘where’ visual pathway.</li>\n<li>Does this model apply to other sensory modalities, not just somatic sensation?</li>\n<li>Yes, this model is indifferent to the underlying sensory modality.</li>\n<li>The more powerful observation is that the anatomy supporting this model exists in most, if not all, cortical regions.</li>\n<li>This suggests that no matter what kind of information a region is processing, its feedforward input is interpreted in the context of a location.</li>\n<li>This may also explain why it’s easier to remember things when they’re associated with physical locations, and why we often use mental imagery to convey abstract concepts.</li>\n<li>The paper also has a list of testable predictions such as cells in sensory regions should be stable over movements. I like this section/list but it’s too long to list here.</li>\n<li>This paper focuses on how the brain makes predictions of sensory inputs.</li>\n<li>The premise is that all sensory regions make predictions of their constantly changing input based on a location signal representing where on an object the column is sensing.</li>\n<li>Although there are many things we don’t understand, the big picture is clear.</li>\n<li>Authors believe that each cortical column learns a model of its world and by connecting these columns, they can resolve ambiguity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"a-case-of-unusual-autobiographical-remembering\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-case-of-unusual-autobiographical-remembering\" aria-label=\"a case of unusual autobiographical remembering permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13554790500473680\">A Case of Unusual Autobiographical Remembering</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Paper describes the case of AJ, a woman whose remembering dominates her life.</li>\n<li>Her memory is “nonstop, uncontrollable, and automatic.”</li>\n<li>AJ differs from other cases of superior memory in that it’s automatic and includes vast amounts of irrelevant information.</li>\n<li>Authors propose a new condition called “hyperthymestic syndrome” to describe AJ; the over-remembering syndrome.</li>\n<li>For AJ, memory has ruled her life and is like a sixth sense, always present like a split screen.</li>\n<li>AJ is 34 years old and since she was 11, she’s had an unbelievable ability to recall her past.</li>\n<li>Whenever she sees a date, she automatically goes back to that day and remembers where she was, what she was doing, what day it fell on, etc.</li>\n<li>It’s become clear that AJ’s memory is different from other cases of superior memory as she isn’t gifted at encoding and retrieving long strings of digits and numbers.</li>\n<li>In contrast to the vast literature on impaired memory and amnesic syndrome, little is known about forms of superior memory.</li>\n<li>Previous superior memory studies have focused on learning long lists of words/digits but none have reported superior autobiographical memory.</li>\n<li>The current view of superior remembering is that their skills are due to the application of strategies acquired through practice, and not through innate abilities.</li>\n<li>AJ differed in this regard as she couldn’t consciously apply strategies to help her learn and retain new information.</li>\n<li>E.g. AJ couldn’t use her talents in school and she had great difficulty with rote memorization.</li>\n<li>AJ described her memory as automatic, not strategic.</li>\n<li>The researchers used a variety of tests to explore her superior autobiographical memory.</li>\n<li>To verify her memory, AJ provided diaries detailing past events from age 10 to 34.</li>\n<li>AJ had grades of mostly Cs with some Bs and an A here and there. She didn’t like and wasn’t good at school and had to study hard.</li>\n<li>AJ reported migraines since childhood, taking medication to prevent headaches.</li>\n<li>AJ’s recall of events from her past is immediate, confident, and with considerable emotion.</li>\n<li>When asked to recall all Easter dates from 1980 onward, she produced all but one date accurately and with what she was doing on that day.</li>\n<li>When tested again two years later, she produced the same list but with the incorrect date corrected and with the same descriptions, matching the previous list and her diary entries, which demonstrates perfect reliability.</li>\n<li>She was able to recall an event given a date, and a date given an event, if the questions were within her areas of interest and the period of her good memory (around 14 years old and onward).</li>\n<li>AJ has a highly developed knowledge of dates and her mental calendar is impressive.</li>\n<li>However, if the date falls outside of that calendar, then she has trouble with it.</li>\n<li>E.g. She couldn’t answer what day of the week April 3, 1955 fell on.</li>\n<li>In contrast to AJ’s strong autobiographical memory and her ability to recall dates and events, she isn’t a gifted memorizer.</li>\n<li>The researchers also tested if her recognition would be better than her free recall and found that it wasn’t.</li>\n<li>How paradoxical that someone with such a powerful autobiographical memory was unable to recall or recognize the details of a videotape recording from a month before.</li>\n<li>Her autobiographical memory, while incredible, is also selective and even ordinary in some respects.</li>\n<li>Her general memory index on the WMS-R is 122, 29 points above her IQ.</li>\n<li>Traditionally, amnesia is characterized by a 15 to 20 decrement between general memory and IQ, so AJ’s memory is quantitatively superior.</li>\n<li>However, we should also remember that neuropsychological tests of memory are designed to measure impairments, not superior memory, and there can be ceiling effects due to the limited capacity to measure high levels of performance.</li>\n<li>AJ’s memory superiority is seen on tests of episodic memory, particularly when she is provided with some degree of structure in the material at encoding and/or at retrieval.</li>\n<li>However, AJ’s scores below average on tests of executive functioning and reasoning, anterior left hemisphere functions, organizationally demanding memory tests, and memory for faces.</li>\n<li>Like another case of superior memory, AJ was not strong in analogical reasoning and had a tendency toward concrete, rather than abstract, answers.</li>\n<li>Tests suggest a left hemisphere dysfunction, with issues in providing linguistically precise responses to questions, impaired facial memory, and a significant loss of detail in AJ’s recall.</li>\n<li>The tests that she doesn’t do well in are unstructured and require considerable abstraction, hypothesis formulation, and conceptual shifting.</li>\n<li>The following discussion weaves threads from separate approaches to offer the reader hypotheses about AJ’s form of extraordinary memory.</li>\n<li>The first important point is that maybe AJ is tricking the researchers or faking it all.</li>\n<li>How do we know that she isn’t rehearsing, practicing, and preparing to fool the researchers?</li>\n<li>She can’t prepare in advance since she didn’t know the dates and events prior to testing.</li>\n<li>Another argument against AJ faking are her scores on memory tests, as it would have been difficult to fake such a profile (set of scores).</li>\n<li>Most of us wouldn’t be able to retrieve what we were doing five years ago from this date, but AJ can.</li>\n<li>Give her an opportunity to recall one event and there is a spreading activation of recollection from one island of memory to the next.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two defining features of hyperthymesia</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The person spends an abnormally large amount of time thinking about his or her personal past.</li>\n<li>The person has an extraordinary capacity to recall specific events from their personal past.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why does AJ have an extraordinary good memory for some things and not for others?</li>\n<li>AJ, while of average intelligence, has significant deficits in executive functions involving abstraction, self-generated organization, and mental control.</li>\n<li>Although AJ isn’t autistic, there are certain similarities such as an interest in dates, repetitive and obsessive tendencies, and a highly variable neuropsychological profile with areas of superiority co-existing with areas of deficit.</li>\n<li>AJ doesn’t calculate the day of the week given a calendar date, but rather uses raw memory to know.</li>\n<li>Evidence for this is because she doesn’t know the day of the week outside of her personal experience, something calculations aren’t limited by.</li>\n<li>AJ’s hyperthymistic syndrome may be a case of highly superior semantic autobiographical memory.</li>\n<li>It’s somewhat surprising that superior memory doesn’t necessarily facilitate other aspects of everyday life, such as school.</li>\n<li>It’s worth questioning just what forms of superior memory benefit everyday functioning.</li>\n</ul>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a
