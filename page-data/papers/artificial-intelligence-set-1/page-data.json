People can learn to recognize a new handwritten character from a single example.</li>\n<li>People learn a lot more from a lot less information.</li>\n<li>The second challenge is the Atari game Frostbite.</li>\n<li>Success in the game requires a temporally extended plan to ensure the agent can accomplish each sub-goal.</li>\n<li>One program, Deep Q-learning Network (DQN), was able to play Frostbite but required a lot more experience and time compared to a professional gamer.</li>\n<li>The differences between the human and machine learning curves suggests that they may be learning different kinds of knowledge by using different learning mechanisms.</li>\n<li>Even non-professional humans can grasp the basics of the game after just a few minutes of playing.</li>\n<li>If humans are able to first watch an expert playing for a few minutes, they can learn even faster.</li>\n<li>Sparse feedback is another difficulty that current AI doesn’t deal with well.</li>\n<li>DQN is also inflexible as changes to the color or appearance of objects would have devastating consequences on performance.</li>\n<li>The contrast between DQN and human flexibility is striking.</li>\n<li>E.g. Imagine you’re tasked with playing Frostbite with any of these new goals: get the lowest possible score, beat your friend but not by much to not embarrass them, discover secret Easter eggs, or touch all ice floes only once.</li>\n<li>This range of goals highlights an essential component of human intelligence: that people can learn models and use them for arbitrary new tasks and goals.</li>\n<li>In contrast to AI, people require little to no retraining or reconfiguration when adding new tasks and goals.</li>\n<li>People never start completely from scratch, and this is the secret to their success.</li>\n<li>Human infants expect inanimate objects to follow the principles of persistence, continuity, cohesion, and solidity.</li>\n<li>These built-in principles are called intuitive physics and they may stem from our ability to simulate the physical world in our mind.</li>\n<li>Pre-verbal infants distinguish animate agents from inanimate objects.</li>\n<li>This is called intuitive psychology.</li>\n<li>It’s generally agreed that infants expect agents to act in a goal-directed, efficient, and socially sensitive manner.</li>\n<li>This ability to predict an agent’s actions may also stem from stimulating a person’s psychology such as their beliefs and goals.</li>\n<li>However, unlike in intuitive physics, simulation-based reasoning  in intuitive psychology can be nested recursively, meaning we can think about agents thinking about other agents.</li>\n<li>Intuitive psychology provides a basis for efficient learning from others, such as teaching with the goal of communicating knowledge efficiently.</li>\n<li>E.g. By watching an expert play, we can infer their beliefs, desires, intentions, and goals of the experienced player and copy them.</li>\n<li>Since their inception, neural network models have stressed the importance of learning.</li>\n<li>Supervised learning aims at improving the algorithm’s pattern recognition capabilities.</li>\n<li>Unsupervised learning aims to gradually match the statistics of the model’s internal patterns with the statistics of the input data.</li>\n<li>Even with just a few examples, people can learn remarkably rich conceptual models.</li>\n<li>Acquired knowledge supports reconfiguration to new tasks and new demands.</li>\n<li>E.g. Changing an object in a game to something else or adding a new goal to a system.</li>\n<li>This richness and flexibility suggests that learning as model building is a better metaphor than learning as pattern recognition.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three important ideas to understanding human learning</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compositionality: that new representations can be constructed through the combination of primitive elements.</li>\n<li>Causality: when the result is because of some underlying process.</li>\n<li>Learning-to-learn: refers to ways that learning new tasks can be accelerated through previous or parallel learning of other related tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>New handwritten characters are created through composition as they’re made up of pen strokes and how these strokes connect together.</li>\n<li>This can be broken down even further where strokes are broken up into simpler sub-part movements.</li>\n<li>All causal models are generative but not all generative models are causal. In other words, causal models are a subclass of generative models.</li>\n<li>Causality can act like a glue that lets core functions stick while others wash away.</li>\n<li>E.g. The feature ‘flammable’ is more closely attached to wood than money because the causal role is derived from the function of objects and wood is more commonly burnt than money.</li>\n<li>Beyond learning, people also understand scenes by building causal models that involve making a story that explains observations.</li>\n<li>This is related to the left brain “interpreter” feature.</li>\n<li>It’s crucial that learning-to-learn occurs at multiple levels of the hierarchical generative process.</li>\n<li>The interaction between representation and previous experience may be key to building machines that learn as fast as people do.</li>\n<li>One limitation of model-based learning is that it eventually becomes a habit, reflecting a shift from model-based to model-free control.</li>\n<li>Some researchers argue that the human brain benefits from even more experience through evolution.</li>\n<li>Successful learning-to-learn is enabled by having models with the right representational structure.</li>\n<li>The paper’s approach is guided by a pragmatic view that the clearest path to a computational formalization of human intelligence comes from understanding the software before the hardware.</li>\n<li>However, we shouldn’t ignore the hardware (neuroscience) either.</li>\n<li>In the case of backpropagation, it’s regarded as a good thing that concerns of biological plausibility didn’t hold back research.</li>\n<li>Natural intelligence is still by far the best example of intelligence.</li>\n<li>An algorithm may take inspiration from neuroscience or cognitive science, but it doesn’t follow that the algorithm learns or thinks like a person.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"intelligence-without-representation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#intelligence-without-representation\" aria-label=\"intelligence without representation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"http://www2.denizyuret.com/ref/brooks/brooks.pdf\">Intelligence without representation</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Paper’s approach to creating AI</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We must incrementally build up the capabilities of intelligence systems, having complete systems at each step of the way.</li>\n<li>At each step, we should let the complete systems loose in the real world, with real sensing and real actions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When we examine very simple intelligence, we find that explicit representations and models of the world simply get in the way.

Automobiles can go much faster than the fastest animal on the planet.</li>\n<li>The fact that evolution produced intelligence therefore indicates that human engineering will be able to do the same.</li>\n<li>However, these arguments for the feasibility of AI don’t say whether the path to be taken by human engineers will resemble the path taken by evolution.</li>\n<li>The fact that human intelligence evolved implies that running genetics algorithms is but one way to produce intelligence; it doesn’t imply that it’s the only way or the easiest way.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two versions of the evolutionary argument</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Argument from problem difficulty</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the claim that because blind evolution could create intelligent systems without any guidance or direction, that we can engineer it in a shorter period of time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Argument from evolutionary algorithms</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the claim that we can use genetic algorithms to simulate evolution and thus achieve AI.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>One assumption of the evolutionary argument is that intelligence was “easy” to create since it could be done with a dumb algorithm.</li>\n<li>However, we can’t validate this assumption because we don’t know how hard it was for evolution.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Imagine two planets that each evolved intelligence independently. However, each planet differs in how hard it was for evolution to develop intelligence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One planet has non-hard intelligence where there was a smooth and incremental path from primitive organisms to intelligent life.</li>\n<li>The other planet has hard intelligence where it took many trials and errors and required an extraordinary time to achieve intelligent life.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In both cases, each intelligent life could claim that theirs was the easier/harder path for evolution and we’re in the same scenario.</li>\n<li>However, the observation selection effect is that no matter how hard it is for human-level intelligence to evolve, 100% of evolved civilizations will find themselves originating from planets where it happened anyways.</li>\n<li>How confident can we be that we’re in the non-hard intelligence path?</li>\n<li>Given our available evolutionary data and under certain assumptions, we find that intelligence is exceedingly hard to evolve.</li>\n<li>To realize the genetic algorithm argument, there needs to be sufficient computing power to simulate evolution.</li>\n<li>We should also realize that not every feat that was accomplished by evolution in the course of the developing human intelligence is relevant to an engineer who’s trying to artificially evolve AI.</li>\n<li>E.g. We don’t have to recreate the path to spiders because only a small portion of evolutionary optimization on Earth has been selected for intelligence, the homo sapiens path.</li>\n<li>One might argue that the key insights for AI are embodied in the nervous system so we could push evolutionary algorithms to develop such systems.</li>\n<li>Evolution achieved human intelligence yet it wasn’t aiming at this outcome as the fitness function for natural organisms don’t only select for intelligence and its precursors.</li>\n<li>E.g.

GLUE, Turing Olympics, and GVGAI.</li>\n<li>We can also apply human intelligence tests to AI.</li>\n<li>One issue is that AI system developers can game human intelligence tests, or any test for that matter, because they know ahead of time what will be tested.</li>\n<li>In this case, the system developers are effectively solving the test problems, rather than any AI.</li>\n<li>Instead, we can use what psychometrics knows to create new types of benchmarks targeted specifically at evaluating broad abilities in AI systems.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Principles of psychometrics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Measuring abilities and not skills. Abilities form the basis of skills.</li>\n<li>Using multiple tasks rather than a single task.</li>\n<li>The tasks should be previously unknown to both the test-taking system and the system’s developers.</li>\n<li>Having explicit standards regarding reliability, validity, standardization, and freedom from bias.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The current state of AI hasn’t been focused on measuring generalization and contemporary research “moonshots” don’t involve any measure of generalization power, with no overlap on the development of flexibility and generality.</li>\n<li>E.g. Go and Starcraft for DeepMind, DotA2 for OpenAI.</li>\n<li>After IBM’s DeepBlue beat the best chess player in the world, researchers were left with the realization that building an artificial chess champion hadn’t actually taught them much, if anything, about human cognition.</li>\n<li>E.g. They had learned how to build a chess-playing AI, but nothing else.</li>\n<li>This is obvious in hindsight, as before DeepBlue chess-playing was thought to capture and require the entire scope of rational human thought.</li>\n<li>E.g. Previous work on psychological studies of chess playing revealed that chess required forms of reasoning, search, planning, and complex perceptual and memorial processes.</li>\n<li>The assumption was that solving chess would require implementing these general abilities.</li>\n<li>Chess does indeed involve these abilities in humans, but it doesn’t require any of these abilities in AI.</li>\n<li>E.g. We can take shortcuts such as searching through the entire future move tree.</li>\n<li>To avoid this issue within AI, we must somehow optimize directly for flexibility and generality.</li>\n<li>Intelligence isn’t demonstrated by the performance of the output program, but by the fact that the same process can be applied to a vast range of previously unknown problems.</li>\n<li>E.g. Since the resulting program is merely encoding the output of that process, it’s no more intelligent than the ink and paper used to write down the proof of a theorem.</li>\n<li>Solving any given task with beyond-human level performance by leveraging either unlimited priors or unlimited data doesn’t bring us any closer to general AI.</li>\n<li>E.g. We could build a hashtable that associates every situation with a solution and it would perform well, but it couldn’t generalize to new situations that it haven’t been hashed.</li>\n<li>Such systems don’t teach us anything about achieving flexibility and generality.</li>\n<li>Current evidence points to the fact that contemporary DL models are like our hashtable example; they just associate situations to solutions without an understanding of why.</li>\n<li>It’s just correlation without causation.</li>\n<li>It’s imperative that we control for priors, experience, and generalization difficulty in our evaluation methods to prevent gaming the test.</li>\n<li>How general is human intelligence?</li>\n<li>No Free Lunch theory: any two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across every possible problem.</li>\n<li>Our psychometric tests don’t help us here as those tests have been designed with humans in mind and carry an anthropocentric bias.</li>\n<li>More broadly, humans have historically had a poor track record when it comes to attributing intelligence to other complex agents around them.</li>\n<li>E.g. Other cultures or animals such as octopuses, dolphins, great apes, and elephants.</li>\n<li>We only call other systems intelligent if they display relatable human-like behaviors that we associate with intelligence, and not some impartial and objective measure.</li>\n<li>An analogy to intelligence is physical fitness. Like intelligence, physical fitness isn’t easily reducible to any single factor, but rather emerges from a collection of interdependent factors.</li>\n<li>We can measure physical fitness in humans by coming up with a diverse set of tests, not unlike IQ test suites.</li>\n<li>E.g. Running a 100m, running a marathon, swimming, weight lifting, basketball throws.</li>\n<li>And across these test results, we would observe clusters of correlations corresponding to broad physical abilities, again, similar to cognitive abilities.</li>\n<li>E.g. Lung capacity, age, previous exercise experience.</li>\n<li>Much like in the case of cognitive abilities, experts would disagree and debate the exact taxonomy of these broad abilities.</li>\n<li>Crucially, we should expect to find that all test results would be correlated and observe a physical g factor, matching the general intuitive construct of physical fitness.</li>\n<li>But is this physical g factor general in an absolute sense, and that a very fit person could handle any physical task?</li>\n<li>No, we aren’t adapted for the large majority of environments that can be found in the universe.</li>\n<li>E.g. Earth’s oceans, Venus’s surface, Jupiter’s atmosphere, or interstellar space.</li>\n<li>Thus, human physical capabilities can be said to be “general”, but only in a limited sense. When taking a broader view, humans reveal themselves to be extremely specialized for the context that they evolved in: Earth.</li>\n<li>The same can be applied to human cognition, as both physical and cognitive capabilities emerged as evolutionary solutions to specific problems in specific environments.</li>\n<li>Both are optimized for adaptability and as a result, they turn out to be applicable for a surprising range of tasks and environments beyond those that guided their evolution.</li>\n<li>E.g. Piano playing, solving linear algebra problems, driving.</li>\n<li>Much like human bodies are unfit for the totality of the universe, human intellect isn’t adapted for the large majority of conceivable tasks.</li>\n<li>E.g. Problems that require long-term planning beyond the lifetime of a human, problems the require large working memory, problems that require an extraordinary amount of previous knowledge, or problems in dimensions higher than 3D.</li>\n<li>We wouldn’t be interested in and wouldn’t even perceive as intelligent a system whose scope of application had no intersection with our own.</li>\n<li>As such, it’s conceptually unsound to have “artificial general intelligence” as a goal, because we can’t directly build systems that are smarter than us, but we can build systems that are as smart as us.</li>\n<li>In theory, it’s possible to create human-like AI that may have a higher generalization power than us, as there’s no a priori reason to assume human cognitive efficiency is an upper bound.</li>\n<li>Such systems would feature intelligence beyond that of humans.</li>\n<li>Paper argues against the perspective of Universal Psychometrics and Legg and Hutter’s Universal Intelligence, but argues that an anthropocentric frame of reference isn’t only legitimate, it’s necessary.</li>\n<li>Developmental psychology teaches us that the human mind is neither a collection of special-purpose programs nor is it a blank slate capable of learning anything.</li>\n<li>The vast majority of the skills and knowledge we posses are acquired during our lifetimes, and our cognition has been shaped by evolution with priors about the world, how to learn, and which problems we can solve.</li>\n<li>However, these priors aren’t limitations to our generalization capabilities, but rather they’re the source.</li>\n<li>To learn from data, one must make assumptions about it.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Levels of priors/assumptions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Low-level: priors about the structure of our own sensorimotor space (umwelt).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Reflexes or that we only see a small part of the light spectrum.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Meta-learning: priors that control our learning strategies and capabilities for knowledge acquisition.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Recall is better the recognition for learning, that information is causal and follows spatio-temporal continuity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>High-level: priors regarding objects and phenomena.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Object permanence, orientation and navigation in 2D and 3D spaces, and innate notions about natural numbers and social intuition.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For AI, the low-level sensorimotor priors are too specific, while the meta-learning priors should be the most important.</li>\n<li>We propose that an actionable test of human-like general intelligence should be founded on innate human knowledge priors.</li>\n<li>But what’s the exact list of knowledge priors that humans are born with?</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four categories of human priors (Core Knowledge Theory)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Objectness and elementary physics</li>\n<li>Agentness and goal-directedness</li>\n<li>Natural numbers and elementary arithmetic</li>\n<li>Elementary geometry and topology</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>While Core Knowledge isn’t a complete list of priors, it’s a working list.</li>\n<li>Author argues that general AI systems should hard-code as fundamental priors these core knowledge principles.</li>\n<li>Intelligence: a measure of its skill-acquisition efficiency over a scope of tasks, with respect to priors, experience, and generalization difficulty.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Thought experiment</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suppose we have two systems that start with the same set of knowledge priors and they go through the same amount of experience with respect to tasks not known in advance.</li>\n<li>The system with higher intelligence is the one that ends up with greater skills.</li>\n<li>In essence, intelligence turns its priors and experience into skill more efficiently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This definition of intelligence is distinct from skill itself, as skill is merely the output of the process of intelligence.</li>\n<li>While this definition can be argued against, the main purpose of this definition is to be actionable, to serve as a useful perspective shift for research.</li>\n<li>“All models are wrong, but some are useful.” - George Box\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/e5877a565c829b43efec1c9d26528f99/e8814/figure2-1.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 36.8%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAHCAIAAACHqfpvAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAzklEQVQY012Q6QqDMBCEff+Xax/AgmAjmKxJiHgf7Ve3Cu38WMeZ2YNkrwPzPO/7rnwYhnEc+75v2zbGKCLqgmmatm17ncj0QzqE4Jwj3XUdvKqqoijgWOu6Uhmq5FrzbV6WxRhzu93LstwOsAQxpcRmehjqvUdHwfpvJoHKVLZxJ2eT01XUK/Zztt5AmgQGFa457oSosh6A/DTrjxoK2vR5sLQuJ/TB9hNZ/shL86xtLY2EGJ3Y2trUJoipjA8eHcWJCzFI4z68kcZ7K+4N5U2V7ReoYVkAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 2\"\n        title=\"Figure 2\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/e5877a565c829b43efec1c9d26528f99/00d43/figure2-1.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/e5877a565c829b43efec1c9d26528f99/63868/figure2-1.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/e5877a565c829b43efec1c9d26528f99/0b533/figure2-1.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/e5877a565c829b43efec1c9d26528f99/00d43/figure2-1.png 1000w,\n/CR4-DL/static/e5877a565c829b43efec1c9d26528f99/e8814/figure2-1.png 1392w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n<li>Skimming the part describing figure 2 and how it’s represented by a Turing machine.</li>\n<li>Skimming the part on Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT).</li>\n<li>Intelligence is the rate at which a learner turns its experience and priors into new skills at valuable tasks that involve uncertainty and adaptation.</li>\n<li>E.g.
