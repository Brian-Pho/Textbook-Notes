It’s the stake one puts up in order to play the game of life.</li>\n<li>Have recently come to appreciate the awesome, absurdist humor of Waiting for Godot.

It is something you must take for yourself.</li>\n<li>It’s one of the great tragedies of life - something always changes.</li>\n<li>People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown. But the single greatest constant of history is that everything changes.</li>\n<li>To exist is to survive unfair choices.</li>\n<li>The only desire the Culture could not satisfy from within itself was one common to both the descendants of its original human stock and the machines they had (at however great a remove) brought into being: the urge not to feel useless. - <strong>Iain M.

Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable – what then?</li>\n<li>If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties.</li>\n<li>If our brains were simple enough for us to understand them, we’d be so simple that we couldn’t.</li>\n<li>If someone doesn’t value evidence, what evidence are you going to provide to prove that they should value it? If someone doesn’t value logic, what logical argument could you provide to show the importance of logic?</li>\n<li>Not everything in science that is formally equivalent is semantically equivalent.</li>\n<li>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. - <strong>Carl Sagan</strong></li>\n<li>As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality. - <strong>Albert Einstein</strong></li>\n<li>The very lack of evidence is thus treated as evidence; the absence of smoke proves that the fire is very carefully hidden.</li>\n<li>Engineering will build the tools to test science, and science will invent the theories to guide the construction of tools.</li>\n<li>Explores formal principles of software engineering based on the common recognition that software engineering is not constrained by any physical laws as we know.</li>\n<li>Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That’s basically what formulas are.</li>\n<li>You can prove anything you want by coldly logical reason, if you pick the proper postulates.</li>\n<li>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</li>\n<li>The best way to predict the future is to invent it.</li>\n<li>The time dilation effect seems to have been made so that people are able to travel to the stars.</li>\n<li>Computer science actually began with its ‘theory of everything’.</li>\n<li>When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems. This is what did Shannon in. After information theory, what do you do for an encore? The great scientists often make this error. They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big thing right off. And that isn’t the way things go.
