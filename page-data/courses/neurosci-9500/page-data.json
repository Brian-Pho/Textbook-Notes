up the possibility of manipulation of these cells to promote recovery after injury.</li>\n<li>To identify such cells, the paper uses genetic tools to specifically address the identity and reaction to injury of a subpopulation of spinal cord cells known as ependymal cells.</li>\n<li>Ependymal cells act as neural stem cells in vitro and contribute to the glial scar in vivo.</li>\n<li>Results point

map cell fate as it tags cells in the beginning and follows the cell’s divisions.</li>\n<li>Two parts are used, the switch (CreER) and the reporter/promoter (lacZ).</li>\n<li>The switch it activated by the metabolism result of tamoxifen, OHT, and results in the expression of B-gal.</li>\n<li>By choosing the appropriate time window, dose, and frequency of tamoxifen treatment, cells of a particular type are irreversibly labeled.</li>\n<li>The switch, when activated, acts as a pair of scissors that slices out the STOP sequence before the reporter and removes it, letting the cell read the reporter DNA section.</li>\n<li>Once the STOP sequence is gone, the cell creates the reporter which is then observed to track cell fate.</li>\n<li>Cre reporting allows inducible, permanent, and heritable genetic labeling.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The paper uses two promoters</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FoxJ1: specific to cells possessing motile cilia/flagella aka ependymal cells.</li>\n<li>Nestin: specific to CNS stem and progenitor cells.

In the adult spinal cord, it’s expressed by cells lining the central canal, endothelial cells, and sparse white matter glial cells.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Figure 1</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shows using

Nestin-CreER and FoxJ1-CreER could be split at least eight times to give rise to new neurospheres.</li>\n<li>Analysis of the differentiation potential of ependymal cell-derived neurospheres revealed that 100% of the neurosphere clones were multipotent and differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes.</li>\n<li>The neural stem cell potential in the adult spinal cord, within the paper’s context, largely lives within the ependymal cell population.</li>\n<li>Ependymal cells self-renew in vivo and aren’t replenished by another cell population.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Figure

of Sox9 population derives from ependymal cells and the Nestin cells are mainly reactive resident astrocytes.</li>\n<li>In addition to the generation of astrocytes, ependymal cells generate myelinating oligodendrocytes.</li>\n<li>Ependymal cells are normally limited in proliferation but it increases dramatically after spinal cord injury.</li>\n<li>Axonal regeneration is inhibited by scar

stimulation.</li>\n<li>Subjects lay still in darkness and eye movements are measured using an infrared camera because visual cues are used by the brain to suppress unwanted nystagmus.</li>\n<li>Two patients without functioning labyrinths developed no nystagmus, while all ten healthy subjects developed a robust nystagmus.</li>\n<li>While inside the MRI bore, patients report a sense of rotation but this sensation often died away after a minute or so.</li>\n<li>Nystagmus, however, persisted with the slow-phase velocity (SPV) slowly decreasing over minutes to a sustained level.</li>\n<li>On leaving the bore, the nystagmus direction reversed and then gradually decayed over a few minutes.</li>\n<li>Paper found that the magnitude and direction of the horizontal SPV were related to static head pitch position (chin up/down).</li>\n<li>With increasingly downward chin positions, the SPV magnitude decreased, reached a null (no horizontal nystagmus), and eventually reversed and became rightward.</li>\n<li>The null position differed among subjects, ranging from around -27 degrees to +32 degrees.</li>\n<li>Eye movement data doesn’t correlate with EMI voltage, and they thus favor a static, non-EMI effect.</li>\n<li>E.g. Increasing EMI voltage doesn’t change SPV but increasing the strength of the static magnetic field increases the SPV.</li>\n<li>The reversal of SPV likely derives from adaptation to the persistent vestibular stimulation.</li>\n<li>To rule out the MS mechanism, the MVS is polarity sensitive.</li>\n<li>E.g.
