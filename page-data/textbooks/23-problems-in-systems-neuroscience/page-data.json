The main excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS of mammals is glutamate, but for insects it’s acetylcholine. Does this matter?

The goal isn’t to store an infinite number of items, but to ease the handling of a smaller number of unpredictable items.</li>\n<li>To use distributed dynamics both to confer stability on each representation in the face of noise and to optimize the filling of the representation space.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We propose that the olfactory bulb (OB) actively transforms a distributed, multidimensional, afferent input into a compact and easily recalled representation.</li>\n<li>In zebrafish, we found that spatiotemporal patterning results in a rapid decorrelation of odor representations.</li>\n<li><em>Decorrelation</em>: that the overlap between the representations of related odors decreases over time.</li>\n<li>However, representation size, on average, remained constant.</li>\n<li>Early epochs offered reliable clues for odor classification; later ones allowed for precise stimulus identification.</li>\n<li>Each odor is represented by a constantly changing assembly in which each active neuron both participates in the dynamics of others, and benefits from the global stability of the assembly, preventing large individual response deviations.</li>\n<li>\n<p>While decorrelating input representations is useful, there are some undesirable effects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perceptual relatedness between odors may be lost.</li>\n<li>Different concentrations of the same odor would cause decorrelation to enhance those differences and say that they’re different odors even though they’re not.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We don’t know how these conflicts are resolved, but possible answers include learning and that early phases of a representation are similar across related stimuli.</li>\n<li>How a neuron behaves may be relevant not as a response, but as part of a transformation to help further processing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-2-can-we-understand-the-action-of-brains-in-natural-environments\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-2-can-we-understand-the-action-of-brains-in-natural-environments\" aria-label=\"chapter 2 can we understand the action of brains in natural environments permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 2: Can We Understand the Action of Brains in Natural Environments?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Authors argue that the lab conditions for testing neuroscience ideas are often unrealistic and unnatural.</li>\n<li>E.g. Subjects have to remain in a fixed position and view unnatural stimuli such as gratings.</li>\n<li>There’s a difference between lab results and the real demands of nervous systems.</li>\n<li>In what context did brains evolve?</li>\n<li>The challenge is that on one hand, we have to collect controlled data, but on the other hand, we have to cope with the complexity of behavior in the real world.</li>\n<li>Work in the later half of the twentieth century showed that certain behaviors can be initiated by stimulating certain brain regions.</li>\n<li>Recently, it’s become clear that the cortex isn’t specialized to only represent one modality in one brain region.</li>\n<li>There are also associative areas in the brain that don’t receive any direct sensory input in invertebrates and vertebrates.</li>\n<li>We are far from being able to answer the question in the chapter title.</li>\n<li>The rest of this chapter is a case study on hunting in the barn owl; demonstrating the importance of natural environments in studying brains.</li>\n<li><em>Hunting</em>: a behavior that can be divided into components such as decision to start hunting, searching for prey, localization of prey, etc.</li>\n<li>Barn owls mainly hunt small rodents such as mice or insectivores such as shrews.</li>\n<li>These animals have to fly out from the nest, search an area of several square kilometers, detect, localize, catch prey, and then fly back to the nest.</li>\n<li>Field observations suggest that barn owls follow a favored route, suggesting memory for places with abundant food.</li>\n<li>Out of the possible 3D coordinate systems that describe the hunting situation, the spherical coordinate system seems to be the closest to the natural coordinate system that the owl uses.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A spherical coordinate system consists of two angles</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Azimuth</em>: horizonal angular deviation of the prey from the midsagittal plane.</li>\n<li><em>Elevation</em>: vertical angular deviation of the prey from the horizontal plane.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We shouldn’t forget that barn owls have adapted to hunting at night or in environments lacking visibility, which explains their heavy reliance on auditory information.</li>\n<li>For sound localization, barn owls use changes in interaural level difference (ILD) for changes in elevation, and changes in interaural time difference (ITD) for changes in azimuth.</li>\n<li>So, the asymmetry in ear position leads to a separation of 2D coordinates, one for ITD and one for ILD.</li>\n<li>The spatial resolution is between one/two degrees in both azimuth and elevation.</li>\n<li>On a neuronal level, this means that the auditory system should have restricted spatial receptive fields, with the tuning to ITD linked to azimuth and ILD linked to elevation.</li>\n<li>Thus, the link between behavior and neuronal activity is known.</li>\n<li>Hunting isn’t only driven by auditory information as owls also use visual cues whenever the target is visible.</li>\n<li>Will the brain know itself in the future?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2

Functions Are Lateralized and Why?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s extremely unlikely that even simple organisms will be bilaterally symmetric given environmental influences during development.</li>\n<li>So knowing this, why are bilateral organisms mostly symmetrical in appearance and behavior?</li>\n<li>One job of the nervous system is to produce average symmetric outputs on the basis of asymmetric structures.</li>\n<li>This brain achieves this by strongly coupling both sides via commissures so that an extensive exchange of information is guaranteed, and by neuronal plasticity, which can lead to the necessary adjustments of neural activity at the two sides.</li>\n<li>Multiple levels of control and neuronal plasticity may restrict and obscure the contribution of a given asymmetrical structure to an observed perceptual/behavioral asymmetry.</li>\n<li>It seems that lateralized functions are based more on networks than on localized functions in the brain.</li>\n<li>Thus, we should focus on hemisphere dominances of brain function rather than structural, cellular, and molecular asymmetries in brains.</li>\n<li>The left hemisphere bias towards processing speech and language function is seen in newborns and is present even in deaf people using sign language.</li>\n<li>However, this bias is also present in the thalamus and for speech played backwards, suggesting that the left-hemisphere dominance isn’t bound to an acoustic speech channel, understanding, or to neocortical functions.</li>\n<li>So, hemisphere dominance of speech processing may be based on the lateralization of more general mechanisms for handling communication-relevant information in the brain.</li>\n<li>We also see this in other species as the left-hemisphere dominance for semantic processing in mice and monkeys shows no basic differences with the left-hemisphere advantage of human speech perception.</li>\n<li>However, why are specializations for communication sound processing found in the left hemisphere and not the right?\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width:

right-hemisphere advantages relate to functions opposite/contrasting with those dominating in the left hemisphere.</li>\n<li>E.g. The left hemisphere dominates successive, temporal, analytical, abstract processing, and positive emotions, while the right hemisphere dominates simultaneous, spatial, synthetic, concrete processing, and negative emotions.</li>\n<li>The hypothesis is that lateralization of brain functions are common to and comparable among vertebrates and express successful evolutionary strategies.</li>\n<li>If we accept this hypothesis, then we predict that a disturbance/weakness of functional lateralization leads to certain deficits in perception and behavior.</li>\n<li>In fact, this is the case.</li>\n<li>E.g. Schizophrenic people show a reduction or absence of a hemisphere dominance for speech processing and perception. In most autistic children, the right hemisphere is dominant in speech processing.</li>\n<li>We don’t know exactly why brains are lateralized, but we have some ideas.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Possible answers</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specialization is a more efficient use of neurons and nearly doubles intellectual capacity compared to a symmetric brain.</li>\n<li>Both halves could do two different things at the same time, aka parallel processing.</li>\n<li>Strong lateralization of neural processing increases the potential, economy, and adaptability of brains and behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These are still largely speculative but do sound reasonable.</li>\n<li>On the genetics side, we hypothesize that genes don’t code for lateralization, but rather for the degree of lateralization.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Why doesn’t the retina directly project to the cortex instead of relaying through the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)?</li>\n<li>Based on a new interpretation of the data, the author suggests that the thalamus doesn’t merely relay information, but also serves a vital role in corticocortical communication.</li>\n<li>Every relay cell of every thalamic nucleus of every mammalian species has displayed the property of low-threshold spiking.</li>\n<li><em>Low-threshold spiking</em>: when it’s easy for a neuron to spike.</li>\n<li>This means that the only messages reaching the cortex from relay cells is by action potentials.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two firing modes of relay cells</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Tonic</em>: slow.</li>\n<li><em>Burst</em>: fast.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>To change the firing mode of a thalamic relay cell, we have to sustain (longer than 100 ms) either a hyperpolarization to switch to burst mode, or a depolarization to switch to tonic mode.</li>\n<li>An analysis of raw information content relayed suggests that the amount is roughly the same during tonic and burst firing.</li>\n<li>However, the nature of the information differs.</li>\n<li>Tonic firing always results in better linearity with the stimulus, which results in the advantage that if the cortex is to reconstruct the outside world accurately, information relayed through the thalamus would have minimal nonlinear distortion.</li>\n<li>So what’s the advantage of burst firing?</li>\n<li>There may be other differences, but the obvious one is that tonic firing is better for linearity, while burst firing is better for signal detection.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 840px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/b06cedfb1a892c4a02722e3dfa568b71/1e088/figure4-2.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 175.2%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 4.2\"\n        title=\"Figure 4.2\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/b06cedfb1a892c4a02722e3dfa568b71/1e088/figure4-2.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/b06cedfb1a892c4a02722e3dfa568b71/63868/figure4-2.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/b06cedfb1a892c4a02722e3dfa568b71/0b533/figure4-2.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/b06cedfb1a892c4a02722e3dfa568b71/1e088/figure4-2.png 840w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n<li>One hypothesis for the two different firing modes is that burst firing is used to capture salient stimuli and thus shift the animal’s attention away.</li>\n<li>For this hypothesis to be plausible, there must be efficient ways for the brain to control the response mode of thalamic relay cells according to behavioral state.</li>\n<li>One place to look for ways to control the response model is in thalamic circuitry.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Pulvinar, posterior medial nucleus, magnocellular division of the MGN, medial dorsal nucleus, and others.</li>\n<li>It’s clear that layer-five afferents are quite unlike layer-six afferents, but that they seem very similar to driver afferents as described for the main sensory relays.</li>\n<li>E.g. Layer-five afferents innervate dorsal thalamic nuclei but fail to innervate the thalamic reticular nucleus, they only activate ionotropic receptors, their axons are thick, their synaptic terminals are large, and many branch to innervate extrathalamic targets.</li>\n<li>This list matches exactly the drivers’ properties mentioned before.</li>\n<li>So, some thalamic relays receive their driver input from sensory organs and relay this information to the cortex (first-order), whereas others receive their driver input from the cortex itself and relay this to another cortical area (higher-order).</li>\n<li>When thought of this way, each sensory system has both types of relay.</li>\n<li>E.g. For vision, LGN is first-order and pulvinar is higher-order. For somatosensory, VPN is first-order and medial posterior complex is higher-order. For audition, MGN is first-order and magnocellular is higher-order.</li>\n<li>Olfactory information reaches the cortex in an unusual way that makes it difficult to fit with this duality, but much olfactory information is relayed by the medial dorsal nucleus.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

V2, MT, and FEF belong to different hierarchical levels but have similar latencies to visual stimulation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Feedforward connections aren’t the sole determinants of response strength and selectivity of visual cortical neurons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. The network of local horizontal connections plays a major role in shaping the orientation selectivity of neurons in V1.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A cortical neuron’s response depends on the activity of feedback connections.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Cooling higher-order areas to inactivate them changes the responses of neurons in lower-order areas.</li>\n<li>Feedback connections appear to potentiate the center response and the center-surround inhibitory interactions for low salience stimuli.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>With this shift to horizontal and feedback connections, we can view the brain as a self-sustained machine for processing mainly internal information and for occasionally sampling from the external world.</li>\n<li>We need to abandon the view of the brain as a simple input-output machine.</li>\n<li>The processing of incoming sensory input depends heavily on the state of the brain at a given moment.</li>\n<li>The role of top-down influences in higher-level vision remains somewhat of a mystery and will be one of the most important questions to answer in the future.</li>\n<li>Review of drivers and modulators.</li>\n<li>It’s likely that such a dichotomy is artificial and that there’s a spectrum of connection types.</li>\n<li>There’s evidence to support the idea that feedforward connections are of the driver type.</li>\n<li>E.g. Inactivation of V1 leads to no activity in V2, which receives strong feedforward connections from V1. It also leads to loss of activity in V4, suggesting V2 drives V4.</li>\n<li>The idea that feedforward connections have a strong driver-type effect may only be true in special cases and may not apply to other types of corticocortical connections.</li>\n<li>It isn’t clear if cortical feedback connections have the same functional role as corticothalamic connections.</li>\n<li>E.g. Corticothalamic connections are much slower than thalamocortical connections, whereas corticocortical feedback connections are as fast as feedforward connections.</li>\n<li>This suggests that the role of feedback isn’t limited to only modulation.</li>\n<li>Feedback connections can’t drive V2 neurons in the absence of feedforward input from V1, but it can modulate the responses of neurons in V2 when they are driven by input from V1.</li>\n<li>This suggests that feedback connections act as a gain control for the responses of a neuron to feedforward input.</li>\n<li>If thick axons always correspond to driver connections, then the presence of a few thick corticopulvinar axons from layer five suggests that not all corticothalamic connections should be classified as modulators.</li>\n<li>It’s likely that we can’t speak of the functional role of feedback connections in general since they vary so much.</li>\n<li>This requires isolating specific circuits and activating/inactivating different inputs to the recorded neuron.</li>\n<li>The center-surround interactions in areas V1, V2, and V3 depend on the feedback connections from MT when the stimulus is masked by a noisy background of similar contrast.</li>\n<li>When the stimulus is clearly distinguishable from the background by its high contrast, feedback connections appear to play a limited role in center-surround interactions.</li>\n<li>It’s likely that local horizontal connections are the major factor underlying short-range center-surround interactions in cortical neurons.</li>\n<li>Feedback connections are fast and their lag isn’t substantially longer than those of lower-order areas.</li>\n<li>It isn’t possible to distinguish local versus feedback connections by the latency of the effect.</li>\n<li>Feedback connections help in differentiating figure from background by potentiating the inhibitory center-surround interactions.</li>\n<li>Another role for feedback connection could be the reorganization of local connectivity.</li>\n<li>IFT neurons are selective to the orientation of kinetic boundaries however, lesions to MT appear to disrupt this ability.</li>\n<li>This suggests that feedback connections act more on the building blocks of cortical processing and less on the higher stages of processing.</li>\n<li>It’s assumed that attention effects in lower-order areas are under the control of higher-order areas through feedback connections.</li>\n<li>However, there’s little published evidence for this assumption and the role of feedback connections remains to understood.</li>\n<li><em>Attention</em>: used to reduce the load of processing sensory signals by selecting relevant inputs and ignoring others.</li>\n<li>Spatial attention has been shown to influence the gain of neurons in several visual areas.</li>\n<li>Research suggests that attention regulates the contrast gain of neuron responses in V1.</li>\n<li>Feedback connections are important for differentiating figure from background.</li>\n<li>\n<p>In generative models, feedback connections play a very different role</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In feedforward models, feedback is used to adjust the processing of sensory data depending on the information and computations made in higher-order areas.</li>\n<li>In generative models, feedback is used to transmit generated low-level data, which is then used to calculate the differences between the generated and actual data.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Perception is no longer an operation of classification, but of matching the generative model to reality.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Neurons communicate in spikes and spike trains.</li>\n<li>However, this says relatively little.</li>\n<li>E.g. This text is written using the Roman alphabet, but this doesn’t tell us anything useful about what’s written.</li>\n<li>Likewise, neurons have to extract information from spikes and also output their result in spikes.</li>\n<li>For early sensory areas, we can determine the neural code by presenting many stimuli and checking whether this code conveys any information about these stimuli.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately, even if we determine the neural code, that doesn’t mean that it’s actually used.</li>\n<li>E.g. There may be a different code that also conveys information about the stimulus.</li>\n<li>From Adrian’s work in 1926, we know that firing rates of sensory neurons change in a consistent way with sensory input.</li>\n<li>This gives rise to the idea that neurons code information in their firing rate.</li>\n<li>However, Adrian’s work also showed that individual spikes arrive in a highly irregular manner, even for the same stimulus shown repeatedly.</li>\n<li>This has lead to different hypotheses about the nature of the neural code.</li>\n<li>E.g. Neurons may encode information in relatively slowly changing rate or in the precise timing of every spike.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately, very few testable models exist that take the extreme view that the timing of each spike is important.</li>\n<li>The closest model is the synfire chain model proposed by Abeles in 1991.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Synfire chain model</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Input elicits synchronized activity in different pools of neurons, where each pool is connected to the next pool.</li>\n<li>Due to the large number of connections from one pool to the next, synchronization between cells of each pool builds up rapidly, and since neurons participate in different pools, the activity of each neuron is irregular.</li>\n<li>Evidence for the synfire model in the cortex is weak at best.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>An intermediate model that has gained popularity in the last decade is a model in which not only the rates of neurons carry information, but also the correlations in their activity.</li>\n<li>A pure rate code has difficulty with the binding problem.</li>\n<li><em>Binding problem</em>: if multiple objects are present and elevated rates in different populations of neurons indicate features of the object, how does the cortex decide which features belong to the same object?</li>\n<li>A correlation-based mechanism has no binding problems.</li>\n<li>E.g. Multiple objects have correlations between activities representative of the same object in different areas, with no correlation between activities due to different objects.</li>\n<li>Evidence supports this idea as the level of synchronization seems to encode whether the stimulation is due to one or more objects.</li>\n<li>However, these correlations are so small that neuroscientists can disagree about whether they exist at all.</li>\n<li>Thus, at present, the only candidate for a neural code with reliable experimental evidence in all cortical, subcortical, and peripheral areas is a rate code.</li>\n<li>Despite the overwhelming evidence that the neuronal firing rates vary consistently with the function being performed, the efficiency assumption would seem to argue against a rate code.</li>\n<li>The rest of this chapter focuses on the effects of variable interspike intervals on the dynamics of neural networks and describes the impact of neuronal spike variability on information transmission.</li>\n<li>Skimming over the chapter’s math.</li>\n<li>It’s important to have a system that can respond to input changes rapidly.</li>\n<li>To respond quickly, the network needs to receive a strongly magnified external input, together with a strong inhibitory network feedback.</li>\n<li>Given that cortical neurons fire almost in a Poisson distribution, this would imply that if the cortex indeed uses a rate code, it’s extremely inefficient.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Arguments against rate coding</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Animals live in a dynamic world and have to respond rapidly to stimuli.</li>\n<li>Brains don’t have the time to average over long time windows to estimate firing rate.</li>\n<li>It’s inefficient if neurons fire as irregularly as those in the brain.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>However, experimental evidence overwhelming supports the idea that the firing rate of neurons carry information about the sensory input.</li>\n<li>Although this may be the rule, there are exceptions.</li>\n<li>E.g. The primary auditory cortex doesn’t use a rate code.</li>\n<li>The fact is that we have very little theoretical understanding about when such a code does well and when it doesn’t.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-9-are-single-cortical-neurons-soloists-or-are-they-obedient-members-of-a-huge-orchestra\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-9-are-single-cortical-neurons-soloists-or-are-they-obedient-members-of-a-huge-orchestra\" aria-label=\"chapter 9 are single cortical neurons soloists or are they obedient members of a huge orchestra permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 9: Are Single Cortical Neurons Soloists or Are They Obedient Members of a Huge Orchestra?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Spontaneous cortical activity of single neurons is often either dismissed as noise or is regarded as insignificant.</li>\n<li>Recent research suggests that such assumptions should be revised.</li>\n<li>Author’s results suggest that our understanding of the neural code may remain incomplete if subthreshold dendritic activity isn’t considered and the role of spontaneous population activity is ignored.</li>\n<li><em>Cell assembly</em>: when cortical neurons organize dynamically into functional groups by the temporal structure of their spike activity.</li>\n<li>The activity of cells in an assembly is time locked however, the cells that make up the assembly may be spatially intermixed with cells from other assemblies that are performing different computational tasks.</li>\n<li>So, techniques that can visualize only the average population activity in a given cortical region aren’t adequate to study cell assemblies.</li>\n<li>Is ongoing activity randomly distributed in space and time, or is its distribution somehow structured?</li>\n<li>Results indicate that spontaneous activity of single neurons isn’t an independent process, but is time-locked to the firing or to the synaptic inputs from numerous neurons, all activated in a coherent fashion even without a sensory input.</li>\n<li>Spontaneous activity of two adjacent neurons was often correlated with two different spatiotemporal patterns of coherent activity, suggesting that adjacent neurons in the same orientation column can belong to different neuronal assemblies.</li>\n<li>In spite of the large variability, the evoked responses in single trials can be predicted by taking into account the preceding ongoing activity.</li>\n<li>Results indicate that ongoing activity plays a major role in affecting cortical response and isn’t noisy, but rather shows a large degree of temporal coherence.</li>\n<li><em>Spontaneous regime</em>: ongoing patterns of cortical population activity that occur simultaneously with the AP of a single neuron.</li>\n<li><em>Evoked regime</em>: a reproducible pattern of activity evoked by the presentation of a well-defined stimulus that’s optimal for that neuron.</li>\n<li>Is there a link between the spontaneous and evoked regime?</li>\n<li>\n<p>To use the orchestra analogy</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We first study the role the neuron plays in the orchestra when we let the orchestra play a familiar tune by presenting it with a stimulus.</li>\n<li>We then study whether the neuron played the same role in the orchestra when the tune was no longer imposed in the absence of a stimulus.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The vast majority of single neurons in the visual cortex have a well-defined tuning curve.</li>\n<li>E.g. They’re selective for stimuli of specific orientations.</li>\n<li><em>Preferred cortical state (PCS)</em>: the optimal spatial pattern for a given neuron.</li>\n<li>One experiment showed that during the presentation of a full-field stimulus optimal for the neuron, the neuron is an obedient member of a larger orchestra; unsurprising.</li>\n<li>Each presentation of the optimal stimulus evoked increased spiking activity and, as expected, the pattern of population activity became more similar to the neuron’s PCS, as reflected by higher correlation values.</li>\n<li>The instantaneous state of the population activity can indeed predict how likely a neuron is to fire at any given moment.</li>\n<li>Next, the authors asked what would happen if we used a non-optimal stimulus on the neuron.</li>\n<li>Does the neuron still prefer to play the same tune? Or does it change?</li>\n<li>Repeating the same experiment but with a stimulus orientation orthogonal to the one preferred by the neuron, we find (as expected) that the PCS doesn’t coincide with the state evoked by the stimulus.</li>\n<li>Once again, we see that the PCS of the neuron, together with the population activity, can predict this neuron’s response.</li>\n<li>Hence, even when not presented with its optimal stimulus, the neuron remains faithful to the orchestra of which it’s a member of, and is most likely to fire when the orchestra plays its favorite tune.</li>\n<li>The spontaneous activity of cortical neurons depends on the underlying functional architecture related to their tuning properties.</li>\n<li>When the network activity happens to be in a particular state, neurons with a preference for this state will have the highest firing rate.</li>\n<li>When a stimulus is presented, it will quickly push the network from whichever state it was in into the neuron’s PCS, which in turn represents the stimulus.</li>\n<li>Results indicate that the spontaneous firing of single neurons is tightly linked to the cortical networks that they belong to.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-10-what-is-the-other-85-percent-of-v1-doing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-10-what-is-the-other-85-percent-of-v1-doing\" aria-label=\"chapter 10 what is the other 85 percent of v1 doing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 10: What Is the Other 85 Percent of V1 Doing?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This chapter argues that there’s still a lot about V1 that we don’t know.</li>\n<li>This argument is surprising because V1 seems to have an ordered appearance with a clear topographical map, and an orderly arrangement of ocular dominance and orientation columns.</li>\n<li>Many neurons in V1 are demonstrably tuned for stimulus features such as orientation, spatial frequency, color, direction of motion, and disparity.</li>\n<li>Our current working model of V1 is that simple cells compute a Gabor-like function and their outputs are summed by complex cells.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

Cerebellum.</li>\n<li>In essence, fixed delay lines provide a way to map the temporal dimension into a spatial dimension.</li>\n<li>Thus, delay lines facilitate a broad variety of computations that involve comparisons between signals received at different times.</li>\n<li>One computation is learning the time structure of a target sequence using Hebbian learning.</li>\n<li>E.g. A synapse at the end of a long axon encodes time-lagged correlations between pre- and post-synaptic activity, while a synapse near the soma encodes correlations at around equal time.</li>\n<li>The first synapse represents specific temporal features of the target sequence, whereas the second synapse represents individual snapshots of the same sequence.</li>\n<li>In both cases, synaptic strengths facilitate the storage and associative replay of temporal sequences by concentrating information in time.</li>\n<li>This allows networks to function as content-addressable memories for spatiotemporal patterns.</li>\n<li>Learning is successful if the structure of the learning task matches both the network architecture and the learning algorithm.</li>\n<li>In this case, all three match and this leads to robust retrieval.</li>\n<li>In networks with a broad delay distribution (highly connected and unspecific), Hebbian learning automatically selects the connections most suitable to stabilize the time course of a target sequence and thus, no modulator or control is needed.</li>\n<li>Increasing a synapse’s strength causes a shift of the spike times of the postsynaptic neuron.</li>\n<li>Thus, synaptic plasticity may lead to large rearrangements of the temporal sequence of APs (also known as a spike train).</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two consequences</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If information is represented in the time-averaged firing rates (rate coding), then these rearrangements don’t significantly change the information conveyed by a spike train.</li>\n<li>If information is represented in the interspike intervals (or individual spike times), then synaptic plasticity may completely change the information conveyed by a spike train.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hebbian learning combined with transmission delays can be used to concentrate information in time, meaning stimuli that were originally spread out over time are grouped together.</li>\n<li>This is an extreme case of time warping where a signal is compressed in time.</li>\n<li>However, this also reveals the problem of performing time-warp-invariant sequence recognition.</li>\n<li>E.g. If speech is played back at two-times speed, we can still recognize and understand the speech. Or how both AAABBBCCCCCCDDD and ABCCD are both the same signal, with the first signal being a threefold time warp.</li>\n<li>How does the brain perform this time-warp-invariant recognition?</li>\n<li>This problem is a special case of the analog-match problem.</li>\n<li><em>Analog-match problem</em>: to recognize a multidimensional input vector (<span class=\"katex\"><span

Why is one coding strategy implemented in the nervous system over another?</li>\n<li>We can answer these questions by comparing coding strategies across species or across sensory modalities.</li>\n<li>Review of the barn owl and it’s sound localization mechanism.</li>\n<li>This chapter focuses on how the frequency range that ITD processing uses has important implications for both the form and translation of the sensory representation.</li>\n<li>Some coding strategies that are thought to be general may only be so at a superficial level.</li>\n<li>E.g. That the primary auditory cortex includes a ventral “what” stream and a dorsal “where” stream. The auditory system’s representation isn’t spatial position, but sound frequency.</li>\n<li>Auditory feature space is most likely encoded in the form of spectrotemporal patterns, meaning the analysis of the excitation along the length of the basilar membrane and how it changes over time, rather than the spatial position of a sound source.</li>\n<li>Major differences do exist between the barn owl and mammalian binaural hearing capabilities, and these differences are crucial for understanding where sensory representations and coding strategies differ.</li>\n<li>E.g. Differences in frequency range for using ITD.</li>\n<li>Experiments on humans for sound localization showed that they performed best for frequencies below 1.5 kHz and above 5 kHz, with most errors happening around 3 kHz.</li>\n<li>This suggests that we use two different mechanisms for localizing a sound source, one operating at low frequencies and one operating at high frequencies.</li>\n<li>Experiments on barn owls show the opposite; they localize poorly for frequencies below 3 kHz and above 10 kHz, but have exceptional localization abilities between these limits.</li>\n<li>This ability to use temporal information at such high frequencies is due to a unique specialization within their cochleae.</li>\n<li>Barn owl auditory nerve fibers are able to signal the fine structure of the sound waveform in the timing of their discharges (phase locking) up to 8/9 kHz, whereas mammals can only lock up to 3 kHz.</li>\n<li>It’s presumed that the higher-frequency phase locking in barn owl hair cells is the result of different hair cell biophysics.</li>\n<li>In humans, the divide between low and high frequencies appears in anatomy with the medial superior olive (MSO) showing an overrepresentation of low frequencies and the lateral superior olive (LSO) showing an overrepresentation of high frequencies.</li>\n<li>This tonotopic organization in subsequent auditory centers in the auditory pathway maintains this separation.</li>\n<li>It’s clear that in both barn owls and mammals, a dichotomy between ITD and ILD processing exists, both anatomically and physiologically.</li>\n<li>The major difference, however, is that barn owls combine the azimuthal ITD cue and the elevational ILD cue to form a topological map.</li>\n<li>The jury is still out on which sound localization code mammals use.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two lessons on the generality of neural codes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s necessary to consider all of the factors that influence information processing in any sensory system since this has implications for how the information may be used in constructing a neural code.</li>\n<li>Conformity of a particular aspect of sensory processing to an established model doesn’t imply general conformity to that model.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Neural codes are only general in parts in sensory systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-15-how-does-the-hearing-system-perform-auditory-scene-analysis\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-15-how-does-the-hearing-system-perform-auditory-scene-analysis\" aria-label=\"chapter 15 how does the hearing system perform auditory scene analysis permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 15: How Does the Hearing System Perform Auditory Scene Analysis?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In order to identify sound sources, the auditory system must group together sounds coming from one source and separate them from other sources.</li>\n<li>This perceptual process is called “auditory scene analysis” since it resembles the analysis of objects in visual scenes.</li>\n<li>On the one hand, learning and memory allow the creation of composite-feature detectors in the sensory system that could be involved in selecting objects from an auditory scene.</li>\n<li>On the other hand, many processes have been identified that don’t require learning and memory and can enable the auditory system to single out objects in a bottom-up process.</li>\n<li>E.g. Auditory stream segregation.</li>\n<li>Inhibition across different frequencies is found on various levels of the auditory pathways.</li>\n<li>Location in space is one cue that characterizes a specific sound source.</li>\n<li>The listener must also segregate objects from multiple different positions in space and suppress echoes.</li>\n<li>And if the source is moving, the listener should dynamically attribute the sound to the same source.</li>\n<li>In the brain, it appears that sounds from different locations are represented in different cortical columns. So by integrating columnar activity, the barn owl could identify simultaneously active, but distinct, columns that encode spatially separated auditory objects.</li>\n<li>The grouping of auditory inputs to determine if they’re from the same stream involves linking neural activity, not only from cells representing one dimension of sound (frequency), but also from cells that represent the other dimensions of the stimulus space.</li>\n<li>The key question is how this combination happens.</li>\n<li>Evidence suggests that neural excitation during very short time periods encodes relevant stimulus features.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-16-how-does-our-visual-system-achieve-shift-and-size-invariance\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-16-how-does-our-visual-system-achieve-shift-and-size-invariance\" aria-label=\"chapter 16 how does our visual system achieve shift and size invariance permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 16: How Does Our Visual System Achieve Shift and Size Invariance?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Our ability to recognize objects from different distances and perspectives under different illuminations gives the impression that invariant object recognition is a trivial task.</li>\n<li>However, an apparently small changes in the stimulus can cause a dramatic change in the retinal activity pattern.</li>\n<li>E.g. If we’re looking at a zebra and shift the strips by one stripe, then many responses of retinal sensors will be inverted, causing a dramatic change of the retinal activity patterns, but you still perceive the same zebra.</li>\n<li>So, to achieve invariant recognition, our visual system has to be insensitive to these kinds of dramatic changes in visual input, while still being sensitive to more subtle changes that are relevant.</li>\n<li>This chapter focuses on two types of invariances: shift and size, and discusses computational models of the visual system.</li>\n<li>Evidence for shift and size invariance comes from two fields: psychophysics and neurophysiology.</li>\n<li>Experiments with human subjects show that recognition of common visual objects is independent of location and size.</li>\n<li>An interesting paradox is that while object recognition is shift and size invariant, we can still recognize changes in shifts and size.\n<span\n

However, when two stimuli are simultaneously presented, the monkey consistently picked the stimulus ipsilateral to the inactivation site.</li>\n<li>Lesion of the FEF produces more dramatic effects as there’s a decrease in spontaneous and evoked saccadic eye movements towards the contralateral side of the lesion.</li>\n<li>Stimuli presented contralateral to the lesion are frequently neglected.</li>\n<li>It’s important to note that bilateral lesions of the FEF with bilateral lesions to the superior colliculus produce a complete lack of saccadic eye movements.</li>\n<li>To conclude, it’s clear from experiments that the primary function of the circuit formed by areas LIP and FEF is to program ocular saccades to specific space locations.</li>\n<li>This shows that lesions to this circuit don’t only produce oculomotor deficits, but also space perception deficits, indicating that space perception isn’t a separate function with a dedicated area.</li>\n<li>To reach for an object in space, it’s necessary to know the initial position of the arm and where the object is located with respect to the individual.</li>\n<li>The transformation of object location into head and arm reaching movements is performed by a circuit formed by areas VIP and F4.</li>\n<li>A large percentage of VIP neurons code space in reference to the monkey’s body.</li>\n<li>Lesions to VIP in monkeys results in mild, but consistent, contralesional neglect for close-personal space with no changes to saccades, eye pursuit, or nystagmus.</li>\n<li>Evidence suggests that visual responses of F4, unlike those of LIP and FEF neurons, don’t signal positions on the retina but positions in space relative to the observer.</li>\n<li>The spatial coordinates of the receptive fields are anchored to different body parts and not to a single reference point.</li>\n<li>Visual receptive fields located around a certain body part move when that body part is moved.</li>\n<li>The most severe neglect in humans occurs after lesion of the right IPL.</li>\n<li>Evidence shows that neglect may selectively affect the far or close personal space differently.</li>\n<li>E.g. In patients with close personal space neglect, if tested at a far away distance, then the neglect dramatically improved or even disappeared. There’s also evidence of patients with the opposite dissociation (neglect for far distances but no neglect up close).</li>\n<li>To conclude, it’s clear from experiments that lesions of the IPL and it’s frontal targets determines spatial perceptual deficits, which agrees with the notion that the dorsal stream plays a fundamental role in space perception.</li>\n<li>However, there is no “space center”. In IPL, there are several circuits that process sensory information for organizing eye and arm movements and it’s their lesion that determines a deficit in space perception.</li>\n<li>IPL not only appears to play a fundamental role in space perception, but it’s also necessary for object awareness.</li>\n<li>E.g. Patients with right parietal lesions have extinction (when two stimuli are presented simultaneously but one is ignored) but when forced to make a same-different decision regarding the two stimuli, they were still able to answer correctly even though they were unaware of the ignored stimulus’s presence.</li>\n<li>This shows a capacity for processing object information, such as category, without being aware in the case of lesion of IPL.</li>\n<li>This also implies that subjects must have parieto-frontal sensorimotor circuit intact in order to achieve object awareness.</li>\n<li>The ventral stream’s processing isn’t enough to get perception without parietal spatial processing.</li>\n<li>The VD stream, in addition to organizing movements requiring space computation, is also involved in the organization of grasping and manipulating hand movements.</li>\n<li>These movements require the computation of the size and shape of objects rather than space.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Area AIP in the parietal lobe provides this function and it has three main classes of neurons</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Visual-dominant</em>: discharge during object fixation and grasping in light but not dark.</li>\n<li><em>Visual-and-motor</em>: discharge in both light and dark but stronger in light.</li>\n<li><em>Motor-dominant</em>: discharge in both light and dark but are silent during object fixation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>AIP is reciprocally connected with area F5 and electrical stimulation of F5 shows that it contains a representation of hand movements.</li>\n<li>Single-neuron recordings show that most F5 neurons code for specific hand actions.</li>\n<li>E.g. Grasping, holding, tearing, and manipulating.</li>\n<li>Neurons of a given class respond weakly or not at all when similar movements are executed in a different context.</li>\n<li>It’s important to note that these neurons respond to object presentation even if no action is taken on the object.</li>\n<li>This isn’t related to motor preparation because the response is present when no motor response is given.</li>\n<li>One interpretation that fits the evidence is that object presentation produces a representation of the observed stimulus but in motor terms: a potential action.</li>\n<li>F5 neurons appear to code for potential action with the stimulus, which may or may not be executed.</li>\n<li>Taken together with IPL, data strongly suggests that IPL is involved in transforming size and shape of objects (coded in AIP) into the appropriate motor schema for acting upon it (coded in F5).</li>\n<li>Further support for this comes from inactivation studies where inactivation of AIP produces a dramatic deficit in the capacity of a monkey to shape its hand based on visual information of the object’s size and shape.</li>\n<li>To conclude, the IPL, while being involved in space computation and perception, is also crucially involved in the organization of object-directed hand movements.</li>\n<li>Skimming over the part on mirror neurons due to mirror neurons not existing.</li>\n<li>In the ventral visual stream, single-neuron recordings show that the coding of visual features becomes more and more complex the further up we go in the visual hierarchy.</li>\n<li>The complexity becomes extremely high in the inferotemporal cortex (IFT), where neurons there respond best to complex visual stimuli such as faces and hands.</li>\n<li>Studies show that neurons sensitive to similar features are clustered together in columns through the depth of the IFT.</li>\n<li>Lesions of the IFT results in deficits in visual capabilities such as being unable to discriminate between stimuli or failure to recognize objects (visual form agnosia).</li>\n<li>However, agnostic patients, in contrast to neglect patients, are aware of the existence of space and motion, and can use this knowledge in a fully conscious way.</li>\n<li>Semantic visual agnosia results in the impairment of the visual representation of objects, while recognition of objects based on their sensorimotor representation was reasonably intact.</li>\n<li>Taken together, evidence argues against the simple view of the action/perception dichotomy.</li>\n<li>Perception and action aren’t independent functions, action comes first.</li>\n<li>Fundamental perceptual abilities, space perception and action recognition, are intermingled with action organization.</li>\n<li>The authors argue that perception can only be explained by taking into account the relationship between the agent and their environment.</li>\n<li>Action is fundamental for building a meaningful description of the visual world.</li>\n<li>The conventional view on space is that space perception is mediated by the activity of a brain center specifically devoted to space representation.</li>\n<li>This view is wrong because there’s no evidence that a “space center” exists in the brain.</li>\n<li>An alternative view, with more supporting evidence from lesion studies, is that the circuits that control action in space also produce space awareness.</li>\n<li>Space perception depends on movement.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-19-what-are-the-projective-fields-of-cortical-neurons\"

Many stimuli that activate the retina are never perceived such as the gorilla-ball-passing experiment and the spot-the-difference pictures.</li>\n<li>These examples show that even though the stimuli activate hundreds of thousands of retinal cones and millions of rods, they go unnoticed until attention is directed to them.</li>\n<li>There’s an enormous amount of information present in the retina which the observer is completely oblivious.</li>\n<li>Somewhere between stimulating the retina and generating a behavioral response, vast amounts of information are filtered out; a bottleneck.</li>\n<li>The bottleneck appears to be implemented as a competitive selection mechanism where attention boosts the responses of neurons in favor of stimuli appearing at the attended location.</li>\n<li>Psychophysical studies have found that when an observer attends to one feature of an object, other features of the same object can be discriminated at no additional cost.</li>\n<li>So when attention is directed to one feature of an object, all of the features that make up the object are automatically selected together.</li>\n<li>However, performance is severely impaired when making identical feature judgments on two different objects.</li>\n<li>This suggests that attention selects whole objects for processing and in doing so, suppresses the processing of the features of unselected objects.</li>\n<li>Further studies suggest that selection of stimuli is mediated/controlled by a biased competitive circuit.</li>\n<li>Consistent with the idea that elevated baseline activity reflects feedback that biases competition between stimuli, when multiple stimuli appear, competition tends to be resolved in favor of the neurons with elevated baseline activity.</li>\n<li>When attention is directed to a stimulus, V4 neurons respond as though the physical contrast of the stimulus is increased.</li>\n<li>\n<p>How attention could bias the competition between multiple stimuli</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attention increases the effective contrast of a stimulus.</li>\n<li>The increase is due to high frequency synchronization.</li>\n<li>Competition is resolved in favor of the attended stimulus.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>While these studies provide compelling evidence that attentional selection occurs through the resolution of competition, they haven’t focused nor answered what type of stimulus representation engages in competition.</li>\n<li>In all of these studies, competing stimuli appeared at separate locations and this confounds selection of locations with selection of objects.</li>\n<li>Thus, competition could either reflect attending to different locations or to different objects.</li>\n<li>However, psychophysical studies show that attention can select out whole objects for processing even when the two stimuli are superimposed.</li>\n<li>E.g. Those pictures where depending on which colored glasses you use, it changes which picture you see. Or those visual illusions such as the vase-face or Necker cube illusion.</li>\n<li>This suggests that attention can select spatially invariant object representations.</li>\n<li>Studies of attentional deficits among patients with right parietal lesions provide further evidence that objects can receive substantial processing before being selected by attention.</li>\n<li>E.g.

problem of understanding the mind by investigating phenomena that are robust and repeatable, and yet don’t fit the big picture of cognitive science.</li>\n<li>We suggest than an additional source of valuable insights might come from good old-fashioned phenomenology and from looking at “odd” experiences that have largely been ignored.</li>\n<li>Wisdom lies in knowing which anomalies to pursue and which ones to ignore.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three criteria for scientific phenomena</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It must be real.</li>\n<li>There must be candidate explanations (hypotheses).</li>\n<li>It must be significant (so what?).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In this chapter, we explore the phenomena of synesthesia.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four arguments against synesthesia</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Those people are crazy.</li>\n<li>Those people are acid junkies or drug addicts.</li>\n<li>Those people are just remembering early childhood memories, maybe from colored refrigerator magnets.</li>\n<li>Those people are just being metaphorical and doesn’t actually mean what they say.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The last two arguments are the most viable, but there are problems with them.</li>\n<li>The idea that “synesthetes are being metaphorical” is an example of the classic blunder of trying to explain one mystery with another mystery.</li>\n<li>In the past, it’s been claimed that Stroop interference shows that synesthesia is sensory but that experiment can’t definitively say that synesthesia exists.</li>\n<li>We hypothesize that synesthesia is mediated relatively early in the sensory processing hierarchy as it depends on stimulus details.</li>\n<li>Evidence strongly supports the notion that synesthesia is a sensory phenomenon, but what causes it?</li>\n<li>The most common type of synesthesia is the number-color type.</li>\n<li>Interestingly, the “number area” of the brain is in the fusiform gyrus and the “color area” is in the fusiform gyrus right next to the number area, almost touching it.</li>\n<li>We hypothesize that synesthesia is caused by a cross-activation of sensory brain maps.</li>\n<li>So, activation of one area automatically activates another area, and the activation is just as strong as direct activation by a real sensory stimulus.</li>\n<li>This creates a vivid phenomenal experience of color that’s virtually indistinguishable from real stimulus-driven sensations.</li>\n<li>The idea that synesthesia is the result of some kind of “crossed wires” isn’t new, but the idea was never put into physiological terms.</li>\n<li>Synesthesia runs in families and may have a genetic basis.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Possible causes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Actual cross-wiring, where there’s an excess of connections between brain modules that are normally distinct or due to a failure in pruning.</li>\n<li>No actual wires, but that cross-activation results from excess activity.</li>\n<li>No actual wires, but an excess activation caused by disinhibition of back-projections from higher to lower visual areas in the hierarchy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We prefer to use the term “cross-activation” over “cross-wiring” since it covers all three potential mechanisms.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two additional questions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If defective genes are involved, why do they affect one brain area and not others?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The genes may be selectively expressed in certain areas due to transcription factors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Does this imply that synesthesia can only occur in adjacent brain modules?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have to remember that even remote modules often have some connections.</li>\n<li>One would expect that the chance of one map cross-activating another increases with the proximity between the two areas.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Evidence from synesthetes shows that it’s the visual appearance of the grapheme (smallest visual unit), and not the high-level concept, that drives the color.</li>\n<li>E.g. Subjects saw colors only with Arabic numbers but not with Roman ones.</li>\n<li>This is also consistent with observations that synesthesia happens in early sensory processing and not the numerical concept.</li>\n<li>However, later synesthetes show that this wasn’t true as they also saw days of the week in colors.</li>\n<li>E.g. Monday as blue and Wednesday as brown.</li>\n<li>What all of these conditions have in common is the idea of a numerical sequence and this ability probably depends on the angular gyrus.</li>\n<li>This is further supported by two cases in the literature of patients losing their synesthetically-induced colors following brain lesions to the angular gyrus and fusiform.</li>\n<li>In some synesthetes, it’s the phoneme and not the grapheme that seems to evoke the color.</li>\n<li>Interestingly, synesthesia isn’t just a bottom-up processes as attention and visual imagery can also control the effect.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

Would they also experience a color that they’ve never seen?</li>\n<li>The striking case of S.S. provides a direct empirical answer to the old philosophical question of whether someone can experience visual qualia that they’ve never experienced before: yes.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two qualia questions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why do only some neural events have qualia associated with them whereas others don’t? What’s the common factor of those neural events that do versus those that don’t?</li>\n<li>What are the functional characteristics that distinguish qualia-laden events from unconsciously processed ones?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four laws of qualia</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Qualia are irrevocable and beyond dispute.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. “This is green” and not “Maybe this is green”.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Qualia are linked to short-term memory.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Qualia can be linked to a potentially unlimited number of implications.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. A spinal reflex arc can only output one possibility, whereas qualia can be matched to unlimited possibilities such as green flowers, green teeth, and green food.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Qualia are always linked to attention.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The first law is seen when the brain fills in the blind spot.</li>\n<li>E.g. If a yellow ring is presented surrounding the blind spot, the brain doesn’t see a ring but a disk because it fills in the ring.</li>\n<li>This demolishes philosophers’ claims that you simply ignore what’s in your blind spot.</li>\n<li>One hypothesis is that qualia occurs when sensory signals reach a certain preestablished criterion of certainty.</li>\n<li>E.g. If something looks 98 percent red, then your brain pretends that it’s 100 percent certain it’s red. Or in the case of the blind spot, if the surrounding is yellow, then we’ll pretend that the entire circle is yellow.</li>\n<li>Once this representation is established, it endures in short-term memory long enough to facilitate subsequent decisions and is tamper resistant from top-down influences.</li>\n<li>This also explains why you can’t unsee visual illusions even though you know how they work.</li>\n<li>The biological function of this genuine sensory filling-in is to confer stability on behavior by eliminating hesitation from subsequent decision-making.</li>\n<li>For a region like the blind spot, it makes evolutionary sense to fill it in because it’s unlikely that the center is different; it’s a useful heuristic.</li>\n<li>Why is synesthesia more common in artists, poets, novelists, and composers?</li>\n<li>One thing that artists, poets, and novelists all have in common is that they’re especially good at using metaphor.</li>\n<li>It’s as if their brains are set up to make links between seemingly unrelated domains.</li>\n<li>Just as synesthesia involves making arbitrary links between seemingly unrelated perceptual entities like colors and numbers, metaphor involves making links between seemingly unrelated conceptual realms.</li>\n<li>Perhaps this isn’t just a coincidence and that the higher incidence of synesthesia in artists is rooted deep in the architecture of their brains.</li>\n<li>We know that high-level concepts and abstract ideas are probably anchored in specific brain regions.</li>\n<li>E.g. A number brain area and a tool brain area.</li>\n<li>If concepts exist in the form of brain maps, then one possible answer to the question linking synesthesia and artists is that there may be excess connections between different brain concept maps.</li>\n<li>This would explain the higher incidence of synesthesia among artists, poets, and creative people in general.</li>\n<li>The evidence we have so far suggests that synesthesia is caused by some sort of glitch or minor flaw in brain circuits.</li>\n<li>Review of the kiki/bouba experiment and pairing it to the sharp or curvy visual shape.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

The redness of red or the painfulness of pain.</li>\n<li>The authors’ strategy is to leave the core of the problem for later (the hard problem of consciousness) and to try, instead, to discover the neural correlates of consciousness.</li>\n<li><em>Neural correlates of consciousness (NCC)</em>: the minimal neural mechanisms jointly sufficient for any one conscious sensation or percept.</li>\n<li>This chapter focuses on the visual system in humans and macaque monkeys.</li>\n<li>It’s generally agreed that much of the activity of our brains is unconscious.</li>\n<li>E.g. The nervous system of the digestive tract and the retina.</li>\n<li>There’s considerable activity in the cerebral cortex that is also unconscious but which leads up to conscious activity.</li>\n<li>How do the neural activities that correspond to consciousness (the NCC) differ from other similar brain activities that are unconscious?</li>\n<li>Our main interest isn’t the enabling factors that are needed for all forms of consciousness, such as a functioning ascending reticular activating system and intralaminar nuclei, but in the general nature of the neural activity that produces each particular aspect of consciousness.</li>\n<li>In other words, our interest is in the contents of consciousness.</li>\n<li>There’s general agreement that much of consciousness is private.</li>\n<li>This isn’t surprising, but what is surprising is the exact nature of these internal experiences.</li>\n<li>Dreams seem to have qualia but there’s no general agreement on this topic.</li>\n<li>It’s often claimed that consciousness has a “unity” but this is unclear and ambiguous.</li>\n<li>It does seem that the brain dislikes contradictory information and often selects a single interpretation, though this may switch over time.</li>\n<li>E.g. Necker cube or in binocular rivalry.</li>\n<li>Can one produce two distinct consciousnesses in one head?</li>\n<li>Patients with a cut corpus callosum show split-brain personalities but this work isn’t enough to help us answer that question.</li>\n<li>What is consciousness for? Why are we not just a collection of zombie systems?</li>\n<li>One possible answer is that zombies wouldn’t produce highly intelligent and flexible behavior since we would need to duplicate human behavior without our brain complexity.</li>\n<li>Is attention necessary for consciousness?</li>\n<li>Since the neural mechanisms that produce attention aren’t fully understood, it’s unlikely that attention can do much to help us to find the NCC.</li>\n<li>Defects in attention can be produced by brain damage.</li>\n<li>E.g. Visual neglect, extinction, and Balint’s syndrome.</li>\n<li>Is memory necessary for consciousness?</li>\n<li>Episodic memory, although it enriches consciousness, isn’t necessary as patients who lack it (due to damage to their hippocampal system) are certainly conscious.</li>\n<li>Other forms of long-term memory, such as semantic and procedural memory, are also unlikely to be major factors in the NCC.</li>\n<li>What we’re left with is that consciousness requires some form of short-term memory.</li>\n<li>The difficult case is working memory.</li>\n<li>A person with small working memory, although handicapped, appears to be conscious.</li>\n<li><em>Bloch’s law</em>: for stimulus duration less than about a tenth of a second, the brightness of the stimulus appears the same provided the product of its intensity and its duration is constant.</li>\n<li>In other words, the system/brain is integrating the input over some short time interval.</li>\n<li>Experimental results suggest that the NCC comes into being abruptly rather than gradually.</li>\n<li>Once the relevant neural activity reaches some threshold, a constant percept of brightness results, at least for a short time.</li>\n<li>Suppose a red circular disk and an identical green disk are flashed simultaneously onto the same place in the retina.</li>\n<li>Unsurprisingly, the subject doesn’t see the individual disks but just one yellow disk (yellow being red plus green).</li>\n<li>However, if the red disk is flashed before the green disk, then the subject still sees a yellow disk but now the yellow is tinted with second disk’s color.</li>\n<li>The subject perceives a mixture of the inputs with a bias towards the later one.</li>\n<li>This turns out to be a general rule and suggests some form of integration, with the later signal having a somewhat greater weight.</li>\n<li>However, if the second disk appears a hundred milliseconds after, little blending occurs.</li>\n<li>This suggests that the integration time is less than a hundred milliseconds.</li>\n<li>Evidence from brain damage patients suggests that certain parts of the brain are essential for a person to be conscious of certain aspects of the visual sensation or percept.</li>\n<li>It’s important to not assume that the brain can consciously detect some particular change in its firing activity.</li>\n<li>It won’t be able to do so unless there’s some essential node to consciously register that type of change.</li>\n<li>The key question is what makes up the essential node?</li>\n<li>As of this textbook, we don’t know.</li>\n<li>There is no place in the brain where it all comes together, no physical implementation of unity.</li>\n</ul>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a
