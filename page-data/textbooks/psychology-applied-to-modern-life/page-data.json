In other words, stress can add up.</li>\n<li>Events that are stressful for one person may not be stressful to another.</li>\n<li><em>Primary appraisal</em>: an initial evaluation of whether an event is irrelevant, relevant, or stressful.</li>\n<li><em>Secondary appraisal</em>: an evaluation of your coping resources and options for dealing with the stress.</li>\n<li>E.g. Can you handle riding the rollercoaster a second time?</li>\n<li>Some people are more prone to feel threatened by life’s difficulties than others.</li>\n<li>Cultures vary greatly in the dominant forms of stress their people experience.</li>\n<li>Culture sets the context in which people experience and appraise stress.</li>\n<li>Substantial evidence shows that cultural changes, such as increased modernization and urbanization, has been a major source of stress in many societies around the world.</li>\n<li>E.g. Racial discrimination and immigration.</li>\n<li><em>Acute stressors</em>: threatening events that have a relatively short duration and a clear end.</li>\n<li>E.g. Final exam for a class or a video game.</li>\n<li><em>Chronic stressors</em>: threatening events that have a relatively long duration and no apparent end.</li>\n<li>E.g. Financial strains, pressures from work, or demands from a sick family member.</li>\n<li><em>Anticipatory stressors</em>: upcoming or future events that are perceived to be threatening.</li>\n<li>E.g. Potential break-up and natural disasters.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four major sources of stress</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Frustration</em>: any situation where the pursuit of a goal is thwarted. Whenever you want something but you can’t have it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Traffic jams, long commutes, putting in work but not seeing results.</li>\n<li>Frustration often leads to aggression or burnout.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Internal conflict</em>: when two or more incompatible motivations or behavioral impulses compete for expression.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Three types</em>: approach-approach (two good choices), avoidance-avoidance (two bad choices), and approach-avoidance (a choice with both good and bad).</li>\n<li>Approach-avoidance conflicts are common and are more stressful than the other two conflicts.</li>\n<li>E.g. Deciding between two items on a menu, deciding to ask out an attractive person.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Life changes</em>: any noticeable alterations in one’s living circumstances that require readjustment.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disruptions of daily routines are stressful.</li>\n<li>More research is needed to determine whether life changes are inherently stressful.</li>\n<li>E.g. Death of spouse, moving cities, vacation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Pressure</em>: expectations/demands that one behave in a certain way.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Two subtypes</em>: the pressure to perform and the pressure to conform.</li>\n<li>E.g. Work pressure, academic pressure, self-imposed pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Different levels stress impacts</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Emotional</em>: powerful, largely uncontrollable feelings.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contrary to common sense, positive emotions don’t vanish during times of severe stress and appear to help people overcome the negative emotions associated with stress.</li>\n<li><em>Inverted-U hypothesis</em>: as arousal increases, so does performance (up to a point).</li>\n<li>The optimal level of arousal for a task appears to depend on the complexity of the task.</li>\n<li>As tasks become more complex, the optimal level of arousal tends to decrease.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Physiological</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Fight-or-flight response</em>: a physiological reaction to threat where an organism decides to either attack (fight) or flee (flight) an enemy.</li>\n<li>This response is controlled by the body’s sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.</li>\n<li>While this response was probably useful in ancestral humans, modern humans deal with more complex problems that can’t be solved by either fighting or fleeing.</li>\n<li>Exposing lab animals to various stressors results in similar patterns of physiological arousal, regardless of the type of stress.</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>General adaptation syndrome</em>: a three-stage model of the body’s stress response (alarm, resistance, and exhaustion).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The body recognizes the existence of a threat and sets off an alarm reaction.</li>\n<li>The body adapts to the new conditions of stress through homeostasis.</li>\n<li>The body becomes exhausted fighting the stress and resistance declines.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>It’s becoming clear that stress affects every part of the body through hormones.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Behavioral</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlike the previous two responses, behavioral responses aren’t automatic and are under our control.</li>\n<li>Most behavioral responses to stress involve coping.</li>\n<li><em>Coping</em>: efforts to master, reduce, or tolerate the demands created by stress.</li>\n<li>Coping responses can be either healthy or unhealthy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Potential effects of stress</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Impaired task performance</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choking under pressure is fairly common in normal people but surprisingly less common in experts and professional athletes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Disruption of cognitive functioning</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Stress disrupts two aspects of attention.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It increases people’s tendency to jump to conclusions.</li>\n<li>It increases people’s tendency to do an unsystematic review of their options.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Burnout</em>: a syndrome involving physical and emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and a lowered sense of self-efficacy that’s attributable to work-related stress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exhaustion is central to the idea of burnout.</li>\n<li>Burnout is a cumulative stress reaction to ongoing occupational stressors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Psychological problems and disorders</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extremely stressful and traumatic events can leave a lasting imprint on victims’ psychological functioning.</li>\n<li>E.g. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from war, rape, serious car accidents, death, natural disasters.</li>\n<li>Common symptoms include nightmares, emotional numbing, alienation, and elevated arousal, anxiety, and guilt.</li>\n<li>The frequency and severity of posttraumatic symptoms usually decline gradually over time, but in many cases the symptoms never completely disappear.</li>\n<li>One key predictor of whether a person will develop PTSD is the intensity of their reaction at the time of the traumatic event.</li>\n<li>Vulnerability seems to be greatest among people whose reactions are so intense that they report dissociative experiences.</li>\n<li><em>Dissociative experience</em>: a sense that things aren’t real, that time is stretching out, or that one is watching oneself in a movie.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Physical illness</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Psychosomatic diseases</em>: genuine physical ailments thought to be caused by stress and other psychological factors.</li>\n<li>E.g. High blood pressure, peptic ulcers, asthma, headaches, and skin disorders.</li>\n<li>The concept of psychosomatic disease has gradually fallen out of use because research has shown that stress can contribute to the development of an array of other diseases.</li>\n<li>Thus, there’s nothing unique about psychosomatic diseases that requires a special category.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Positive effects</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The effects of stress aren’t entirely negative.</li>\n<li>Some psychologists have argued that psychology has focused too much on the negative aspects of the mind and how to heal suffering, neglecting the forces that make life worth living.</li>\n<li>This movement has been called “positive psychology” and it seeks to shift the field’s focus away from negative experiences to more positive experiences.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three ways stress can have positive effects</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Stress can promote positive psychological change.</li>\n<li>Stressful events help satisfy the need for stimulation and challenge, a basic need of the human organism.</li>\n<li>Stress can help prepare people to be less affected by future stress; improving stress tolerance.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why do some people handle stress better than others?</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s due to a number of moderator variables such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Social support</em>: aid provided by social networks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social support could promote wellbeing by dampening the intensity of physiological reactions to stress, reducing health-impairing behaviors, and fostering more constructive coping efforts.</li>\n<li>Studies also show that providing social support can also have benefits but there are potential drawbacks such as conflict, additional responsibilities, and dependency.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Hardiness</em>: a disposition marked by commitment, challenge, and control that may be associated with strong stress resistance.</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Optimism</em>: a general tendency to expect good outcomes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 20 years of research has consistently shown that optimism is associated with better mental and physical health.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

One literature review found over 400 distinct coping techniques.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It’s most adaptive to use a variety of coping strategies.</li>\n<li>Coping strategies vary in their adaptive value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>No coping strategy can guarantee a successful outcome as the adaptive value of a coping technique depends on the exact nature of the situation.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Common non-optimal coping mechanisms</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Giving up</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Learned helplessness</em>: a passive behavior produced by exposure to unavoidable aversive events.</li>\n<li>E.g. When lab animals were given electric shocks that they couldn’t escape from, they were given two choices. One choice was an opportunity to learn a response that would allow them to escape the shock, the other choice was to give up. Many of the animals chose to give up. Human subjects show parallel results.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately, this tendency to give up may be transferred to situations where one isn’t really helpless.</li>\n<li>Some people routinely respond to stress with fatalism and resignation.</li>\n<li>Helplessness seems to occur when people come to believe that events are beyond their control.</li>\n<li>However, giving up can be adaptive in some situations where you’re genuinely helpless.</li>\n<li>Withdrawing effort from unattainable goals can be an effective coping strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aggression</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Aggression</em>: any behavior intended to hurt someone, either physically or verbally.</li>\n<li>Lashing out at others with verbal aggression tends to be ineffective and often backfires, creating additional stress.</li>\n<li>Frustration does frequently elicit aggression.</li>\n<li><em>Catharsis</em>: the release of emotional tension.</li>\n<li>It’s common to believe that “blowing off steam” is good advice but evidence shows otherwise.</li>\n<li>Experimental research has generally not supported catharsis and most studies find the opposite: behaving in an aggressive manner tends to fuel more anger and aggression.</li>\n<li>Exposure to media violence not only desensitizes people to violent acts, but it also encourages aggressive self-views and automatic aggressive responses.</li>\n<li>Evidence suggests that video games and violent media don’t provide a cathartic effect, but rather increase aggressive tendencies.</li>\n<li>As a coping strategy, acting aggressively has little value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Self-indulgence</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A common response to stress is to reward yourself in another area of your life.</li>\n<li>E.g.

by social, psychological, and biological factors.</li>\n<li>This chapter focuses on the fact that more than at any other time in history, people’s health is more likely to be compromised by chronic diseases, rather than contagious diseases.</li>\n<li>Lifestyle and stress play a much larger role in the development of chronic diseases than they do in contagious diseases.</li>\n<li>Today, the three leading chronic diseases (heart disease, cancer, and stroke) account for almost 60% of all deaths in the USA.</li>\n<li><em>Biopsychosocial model</em>: that physical illness is caused by a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors.</li>\n<li><em>Health psychology</em>: how psychosocial factors relate to the promotion and maintenance of health and with the causation, prevention, and treatment of illness.</li>\n<li>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the USA, accounting for nearly 27% of deaths.</li>\n<li><em>Coronary heart disease</em>: a reduction in blood flow through the arteries that supply the heart with blood.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two personality types</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Type A</em>: strong competitive orientation, impatient and time urgent, and anger and hostility.</li>\n<li><em>Type B</em>: relatively relaxed, patient, easygoing, and amicable behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Research has uncovered a modest correlation between Type A behavior and increased coronary risk.</li>\n<li><em>Hostility</em>: a persistent negative attitude marked by cynical, mistrusting thoughts, feelings of anger, and overtly aggressive actions.</li>\n<li>Recent research suggests that hostility may be the crucial toxic element that accounts for the correlation between Type A behavior and heart disease.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Possible explanations linking anger and hostility</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anger-prone individuals appear to exhibit greater physiological reactivity than those lower in hostility.</li>\n<li>Hostile people probably create additional stress for themselves.</li>\n<li>Hostile individuals tend to have less social support than others.</li>\n<li>People high in anger and hostility seem to exhibit a higher prevalence of poor health habits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Depression roughly doubles the chances of developing heart disease.</li>\n<li><em>Cancer</em>: malignant cell growth that occurs in the body.</li>\n<li>Stress is related to (but isn’t necessarily causally linked to) cancer.</li>\n<li>The apparent link between stress and many types of illness probably reflects the fact that stress can undermine the body’s immune functioning.</li>\n<li>The duration of a stressful event is a key factor determining its impact on immune function.</li>\n<li>Stress can temporarily suppress human immune functioning, which can make people more vulnerable to infectious disease agents.</li>\n<li>Health-impairing habits contribute to far more deaths than most people realize.</li>\n<li>It may seem puzzling that people behave in self-destructive ways. Why?</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are several factors</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Many health-impairing habits slowly creep up on people.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Drug use or exercising less.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Many health-impairing habits involve activities that are quite pleasant.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Smoking and eating fatty foods.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s relatively easy to ignore risks that lie in the distant future.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Chronic diseases such as cancer take time to develop.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>People have a tendency to underestimate the risks associated with their own health-impairing habits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Skipping over the section on how health is affected by smoking, drinking, overeating, exercise, and reactions to illness and drug effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-6-the-self\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-6-the-self\" aria-label=\"chapter 6 the self permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 6: The Self</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This chapter focuses on the self and its important role in adjustment.</li>\n<li>If you were asked to describe yourself, what would you say?</li>\n<li>You’d probably start off with some physical attributes and move on to psychological characteristics.</li>\n<li>E.g. I’m tall, average weight, blonde, friendly, honest, and intelligent.</li>\n<li>People probably define themselves by highlighting how they’re different from others.</li>\n<li><em>Self-concept</em>: an organized collection of beliefs about the self.</li>\n<li>These beliefs are developed from past experience and are concerned with one’s personality traits, abilities, physical features, values, goals, and social roles.</li>\n<li><em>Possible selves</em>: one’s conceptions about the kind of person one might become in the future.</li>\n<li>People’s beliefs about themselves aren’t set in stone, but they’re not easily changed either.</li>\n<li>Once the self-concept is established, the individual has a tendency to preserve and defend it.</li>\n<li>Some people perceive themselves pretty much the way they’d like to see themselves.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three types of self</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Actual</em>: qualities actually possessed.</li>\n<li><em>Ideal</em>: qualities would like to possess.</li>\n<li><em>Ought</em>: qualities should possess.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Self-discrepancy</em>: a mismatch between the self-perceptions that make up the actual self, the ideal self, and the ought self.</li>\n<li>People with low self-discrepancy experience high self-esteem, while the opposite is true.</li>\n<li>Everyone experiences self-discrepancies, but most people manage to feel good about themselves.</li>\n<li>This is due to the amount of discrepancy you experience, your awareness of the discrepancy, and whether the discrepancy is actually important to you.</li>\n<li>One way to cope with self-discrepancies is to change your behavior to bring it more in line with your ideal and ought selves.</li>\n<li>Another way is to bring your ideal self more in line with your actual self.</li>\n<li>Another, less positive, approach is to blunt your self-awareness so that you focus less on judging yourself.</li>\n<li>E.g. If your weight is bothering you, you might stay off the scale or avoid looking into a mirror.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Factors that influence self-concept</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Self-observations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People begin observing and judging their own behavior early in life.</li>\n<li><em>Social comparison theory</em>: individuals compare themselves with others in order to assess their abilities and opinions.</li>\n<li>Social comparison is used to accurately assess one’s abilities, but also to improve their skills and to maintain their self-image.</li>\n<li>E.g. Comparing your current self to your past self.</li>\n<li><em>Reference group</em>: a set of people who are used as a gauge in making social comparisons.</li>\n<li>Upward social comparisons can motivate you to change, while downward social comparisons can boost self-esteem.</li>\n<li>People’s observations of their own behavior aren’t entirely objective and tend to be in a positive direction.</li>\n<li>E.g. 100% of respondents saw themselves as above average, while 25% of them thought that they belonged in the top 1%.</li>\n<li>This better-than-average effect seems to be a common phenomenon.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Feedback from others</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Early in life, feedback from parents is especially tied to a child’s self-concept.</li>\n<li>Later in life, feedback from close friends and marriage partners takes importance.</li>\n<li>Individuals don’t see themselves exactly as others see them but rather as they believe others see them.</li>\n<li>Thus, feedback from others usually reinforces people’s self-views.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cultural values</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The society that one grows up in defines what’s desirable and undesirable in personality and behavior.</li>\n<li>One important way cultures differ is on the dimension of individualism versus collectivism.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Self-esteem</em>: one’s overall assessment of one’s worth as a person.</li>\n<li>People with high self-esteem are confident, take credit for their actions, and are relatively sure of who they are.</li>\n<li>People with low self-esteem aren’t more negative, but rather they’re more confused and tentative.</li>\n<li>People with low self-esteem simply don’t know themselves well enough to strongly endorse many personal attributes on self-esteem tests, which results in lower self-esteem scores.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Self-esteem can be interpreted in two ways</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Trait</em>: the ongoing sense of confidence in your abilities and characteristics.</li>\n<li><em>State</em>: how individuals feel about themselves in the moment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Investigating self-esteem is challenging because it’s difficult to measure, relies on self-report, and it’s difficult to separate cause from effect.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Advantages of having a high self-esteem</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More positive emotions such as happiness</li>\n<li>More likely to speak up and criticize the group’s approach</li>\n<li>Persists longer in the face of failure</li>\n<li>Affects expectations in a reinforcing way</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Although high self-esteem is desirable, problems arise when people’s self-views are inflated and unrealistic as they’re often labeled as narcissistic.</li>\n<li>Aggression in response to self-esteem threats is more likely to occur in people who are narcissistic.</li>\n<li>Parents, teachers, coaches, and other adults play a key role in shaping self-esteem.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four parenting styles</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Authoritative</em>: high acceptance, high control.</li>\n<li><em>Authoritarian</em>: low acceptance, high control.</li>\n<li><em>Permissive</em>: high acceptance, low control.</li>\n<li><em>Neglectful</em>: low acceptance, low control.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Authoritative and permissive parenting styles lead to the highest self-esteem for the child.</li>\n<li>Review of the cocktail party effect.</li>\n<li><em>Self-attributions</em>: inferences that people draw about the causes of their own behavior.</li>\n<li>People routinely make attributions to make sense out of their experiences.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Attributions are made along six dimensions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Internal</em>: personal factors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Saying that your failure to adequately prepare for the test or getting anxious as the cause for failing the test.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>External</em>: environmental factors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Saying that the course or the teacher marked unfairly as the cause for failing the test.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Stable</li>\n<li>Unstable</li>\n<li>Controllable</li>\n<li>Uncontrollable</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Whether one’s self-attributions are internal or external can have tremendous impact on one’s personal adjustment.</li>\n<li><em>Explanatory style</em>: the tendency to use similar causal attributions for a wide variety of events in one’s life.</li>\n<li>People with an optimistic explanatory style usually attribute setbacks to external, unstable, and specific factors, and this lets them bounce back from setbacks and helps to maintain a favorable self-image.</li>\n<li>In contrast, people with a pessimistic explanatory style usually attribute setbacks to internal, stable, and global factors.</li>\n<li>A pessimistic style can foster passive behavior and it makes people more vulnerable to learned helplessness and depression.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four major motives for seeking self-understanding</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Assessment</em>: drive for truthful information about themselves.</li>\n<li><em>Verification</em>: drive towards information that matches what they already believe about themselves.</li>\n<li><em>Improvement</em>: drive to change themselves after failure.</li>\n<li><em>Enhancement</em>: drive to maintain positive feelings about oneself.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Downward social comparison</em>: a defensive tendency to compare oneself with someone whose troubles are more serious than one’s own.</li>\n<li><em>Self-serving bias</em>: the tendency to attribute one’s successes to personal factors and one’s failures to situational factors.</li>\n<li><em>Self-handicapping</em>: the tendency to sabotage one’s performance to provide an excuse for possible failure.</li>\n<li>E.g. Not preparing for a test and then saying you did poorly because you didn’t prepare.</li>\n<li>Self-handicapping differs from defensive pessimism in that pessimists are motivated to avoid bad outcomes, whereas self-handicappers undermine their own effects (self-defeating behavior).</li>\n<li>While self-handicapping may save you from negative self-attributions about your ability, it doesn’t prevent others from making different negative attributions about you.</li>\n<li><em>Self-control</em>: the process of directing and controlling one’s behavior.</li>\n<li>Self-control has been shown to be a resource that can be depleted when used.</li>\n<li>Self-efficacy isn’t concerned with the skills you have, but with your beliefs about what you can do with those skills.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four sources of self-efficacy</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Mastery experiences</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The most effective path to self-efficacy is through mastering new skills.</li>\n<li>Ironically, difficulties and failures can ultimately contribute to the development of a strong sense of self-efficacy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Vicarious experiences</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Another way to improve self-efficacy is by watching others perform a skill that you want to learn.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Persuasion/encouragement</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Self-efficacy can also be developed through the encouragement of others.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Interpretation of emotional arousal</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>People typically act in their own self-interest.</li>\n<li>E.g.

A single bad deed can eliminate a good reputation, but a good deed can’t redeem an otherwise bad reputation.</li>\n<li>Thus, in the realm of perceptions, bad impressions tend to be stronger than good ones.</li>\n<li>For impressions where accuracy isn’t a priority, snap judgments are often used to judge a person.</li>\n<li>However, when accuracy is a priority, people make systematic judgments rather than snap judgements.</li>\n<li>In systematic judgments, people are interested in learning why the person behaves in a certain way to predict their future behavior.</li>\n<li><em>Perceiver expectations</em>: how your expectations of others can influence your perception of others.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two principles of perceiver expectations</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Confirmation bias</em>: the tendency to seek information that supports one’s beliefs while not pursuing information that argues against those beliefs.</li>\n<li><em>Self-fulfilling prophecy</em>: when expectations about a person cause them to behave in ways that confirm the expectations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>People often take the easy path of categorizing others to avoid expending the cognitive effort that would be necessary for a more accurate impression.</li>\n<li>E.g. Us versus them.</li>\n<li><em>Stereotype</em>: beliefs that people have certain characteristics because of their membership in a particular group.</li>\n<li>Attractive people are often attributed with unsupported positive characteristics due to their appearance.</li>\n<li>However, they’re not any different from others in intelligence, happiness, mental health, or self-esteem.</li>\n<li>Thus, attractive people are perceived in a more favorable light than is actually justified.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately, the positive biases toward attractive people also operate in reverse, with unattractive people being unjustifiable seen as less well adjusted than others.</li>\n<li>Research on attractiveness in relationships shows that the correlation between lovers’ respective levels of attractiveness is fairly robust.</li>\n<li>Because stereotyping is automatic, some psychologists are pessimistic about being able to control it, while others are more optimistic.</li>\n<li>One way to reduce prejudice is to exert some self-control over one’s view of others.</li>\n<li>One reason stereotypes persist is because they’re functional, meaning they help us trade accuracy for speed when thinking about others.</li>\n<li>Stereotypes also endure because of confirmation bias.</li>\n<li><em>Fundamental attribution error</em>: the tendency to explain other people’s behavior as the result of personal, rather than situational, factors.</li>\n<li>A person’s behavior at any given time may or may not reflect their personality/character, but observers tend to assume that it does.</li>\n<li>A person’s behavior may be due to the situation/context that they’re in and not who they are.</li>\n<li>Again, the fundamental attribution error occurs because people are cognitively lazy.</li>\n<li>The first attribution step occurs spontaneously but the second step requires cognitive effort.</li>\n<li>So it’s easy to stop after the first step and thus make a snap judgement without taking situation and context into consideration.</li>\n<li>However, when people are motivated to form accurate impressions of others, they do expend the effort to complete the second step.</li>\n<li><em>Defensive attribution</em>: a tendency to blame victims for their misfortune, so that one feels less likely to be victimized in a similar way.</li>\n<li>This attribution is a self-protective, but irrational, strategy for dealing with thoughts of catastrophes that could happen to oneself.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three themes in person perception</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Efficiency</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People prefer to not exert much effort/time in forming their impressions of others.</li>\n<li>A lot of social information is processed automatically and effortlessly.</li>\n<li>Advantages include quick and simple, disadvantages include inaccurate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Selectivity</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People see what they expect to see.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consistency</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Considerable research supports the idea that first impressions are powerful.</li>\n<li><em>Primacy effect</em>: when the initial information carries more weight than subsequent information.</li>\n<li>Thus, getting off on the wrong foot may be particularly damaging.</li>\n<li>Why are primacy effects so potent? Because people find comfort in cognitive consistency.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><em>Prejudice</em>: a negative attitude toward members of a group.</li>\n<li><em>Discrimination</em>: behaving differently, usually unfairly, towards the members of a group.</li>\n<li>While these two terms tend to go together, there are cases when they’re separate.</li>\n<li>E.g. Restaurants can still serve Chinese couples but have a prejudice against them. Likewise, a manager can favor black people but not hire them because his boss would be upset.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block;

prejudice</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Authoritarianism</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People who are right-wing authoritative score low on openness to experience and conscientiousness and tend to be more politically conservative.</li>\n<li>What causes these people to be prejudiced?</li>\n<li>They tend to organize their world into ‘us’ versus ‘them’ groups and view the ‘them’ group as challenging cherished traditional values.</li>\n<li>They also tend to be more self-righteous and believe that they’re more moral than others.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cognitive distortions and expectations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Much of prejudice is rooted in automatic cognitive processes that operate without conscious intent.</li>\n<li>Stereotyping plays a large role in prejudice.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Competition between groups</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One study found that groups often respond more negatively to competition than individuals do.</li>\n<li>The lack of jobs or other important resources can also create competition between social groups.</li>\n<li>There’s ample evidence that conflict over actual and perceived scarcity of resources can prejudice individuals toward outgroup members.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Threats to social identity</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Threats to social identity are more likely to provoke responses that foster prejudice and discrimination.</li>\n<li>When threatened, groups react in two ways.</li>\n<li>The most common response is to show ingroup favoritism by preferring group members over outgroup members.</li>\n<li>The second way to deal with threats to social identity is to engage in outgroup derogation by trashing outgroups that are perceived as threatening.</li>\n<li>Ingroups reward their own members and withhold rewards from outgroups, rather than deliberately blocking outgroups from desired resources.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reducing prejudice</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cognitive strategies</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This requires a shift from automatic processing of others to a controlled processing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intergroup contact</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Talking up the other group’s good points and downplaying the bad points didn’t help.</li>\n<li>However, cooperating to reach common goals can reduce conflict if it results in successful outcomes and meaningful connections.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Persuasion</em>: the communication of arguments and information intended to change another person’s attitudes.</li>\n<li><em>Attitudes</em>: beliefs and feelings about people, objects, and ideas.</li>\n<li>It’s assumed that attitudes predict behavior.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four elements of persuasion</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Source: person who sends a message.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Persuasion tends to be more successful when the source has high credibility (expertise and trustworthiness).</li>\n<li>Trustworthiness is enhanced when people appear to argue against their own interests.</li>\n<li>Likeability is another major source factor and includes physical attractiveness and similarity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Receiver: person whom the message is sent to.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Need for cognition</em>: tendency to seek out and enjoy effortful thought, problem-solving activities, and in-depth analysis.</li>\n<li>Such people are more likely to be convinced by high-quality arguments than superficial analyses.</li>\n<li>When receivers are forewarned about a persuasion attempt, it’s becomes harder to persuade them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Message: the information transmitted by the source.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generally, two-sided arguments are more effective and it can increase credibility with your audience.</li>\n<li>Arousal of fear often increases persuasion too.</li>\n<li>Generating positive feelings is also an effective way to persuade people such as laughter.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Channel: the medium through which the message is sent.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Why are people persuaded sometimes?</li>\n<li><em>Elaboration likelihood model</em>: a person’s thoughts about a persuasive message (rather than the actual message itself) will determine whether attitude change will occur.</li>\n<li>Persuasion can occur by two different routes: central and peripheral.</li>\n<li>The central route results in longer-lasting attitude changes and stronger attitudes than the peripheral route.</li>\n<li>\n<p>For the central route to override the peripheral route, two requirements must be met</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Receivers must be motivated to process the persuasive message.</li>\n<li>Receivers must have the ability to grasp the message.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Conformity</em>: when people yield to real or imagined social pressure.</li>\n<li>People easily explain the behavior of others as conforming but don’t think of their own actions this way.</li>\n<li>People often believe that they’re alone in a crowd of sheep.</li>\n<li>Review of Asch’s conformity experiment.</li>\n<li>Subjects varied considerably in their tendency to conform.</li>\n<li>Group size and group unanimity are key determinants of conformity.</li>\n<li>As group size increases, conformity increases up to a point.</li>\n<li>Also, group size doesn’t matter if just one person disagrees with the others, breaking the unanimous agreement.</li>\n<li><em>Compliance</em>: a type of conformity where private beliefs aren’t changed.</li>\n<li>E.g. Wearing a formal suit to work even though your personal belief is that you’d prefer not to.</li>\n<li><em>Normative influence</em>: when people conform to social norms for fear of negative social consequences.</li>\n<li><em>Informational influence</em>: when people look to others for how to behave in ambiguous situations.</li>\n<li><em>Bystander effect</em>: the tendency for people to be less likely to provide help when others are present because they assume that someone else will provide help.</li>\n<li>E.g. No one calling emergency services because they assume someone else will.</li>\n<li>Thankfully, the bystander effect is less likely to occur when the need for help is very clear.</li>\n<li><em>Obedience</em>: a form of compliance when people follow commands from someone in a position of authority.</li>\n<li>Review of Milgram’s shock experiment to test obedience.</li>\n<li>\n<p>What caused the obedient behavior observed by Milgram?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The demands escalated gradually so the strong shocks were only given after the participant was well into the experiment.</li>\n<li>Participants were told that the authority figure, not the person doing the shocking, was responsible if anything happened to the learner.</li>\n<li>Participants were evaluated in terms of the authority figure, not by their harmful effects on the victim.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These findings suggest that human behavior is determined not by the kind of person one is, but instead the kind of situation one is in.</li>\n<li>Obedience research shows us the chilling fact that most people can be coerced into engaging in actions that violate their morals and values.</li>\n<li>Once people agree to something, they tend to stick with their initial commitment.</li>\n<li><em>Foot-in-the-door (FITD) technique</em>: getting people to agree to a small request to increase the chances that they’ll agree to a larger request later.</li>\n<li>FITD is widely used in advertising to get people to commit to some request.</li>\n<li>E.g. Giving people a free trial before launching their hard sell.</li>\n<li>Why do FITD work? The best explanation is self-perception theory in that people sometimes infer their attitudes by observing their own behavior.</li>\n<li><em>Lowball technique</em>: getting someone to commit to an attractive proposition before its hidden costs are revealed.</li>\n<li>E.g. Getting someone to buy a car but not revealing the hidden dealership costs.</li>\n<li>Lowballing is a surprisingly effective strategy to get someone to commit.</li>\n<li><em>Reciprocity principle</em>: the rule that one should pay back in kind what one receives from others.</li>\n<li>E.g. Charities frequently make use of this principle.</li>\n<li><em>Door-in-the-face (DITF) technique</em>: making a large request that is likely to be turned down in order to increase the chances that people will agree to a smaller request later.</li>\n<li>E.g. Starting with a high priced car but then trying to sell a lower priced car.</li>\n<li>DITF only works if there’s no delay between the two requests.</li>\n<li>Advertisers often try to artificially create scarcity to make their products seem more desirable.</li>\n<li>To be forewarned is to be forearmed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-8-interpersonal-communication\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-8-interpersonal-communication\" aria-label=\"chapter 8 interpersonal communication permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 8: Interpersonal Communication</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Sometimes, it’s not so much what people say that matters, but how they say it.</li>\n<li>To be an effective communicator, you need to pay attention to both speaking and listening.</li>\n<li>Review of sender, receiver, message, noise, and channel.</li>\n<li>The primary means of sending a message is language, but people also communicate to others nonverbally through facial expressions, gestures, and vocal inflections.</li>\n<li><em>Nonverbal communication (NC)</em>: the transmission of meaning through symbols other than words.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Women use touch to convey closeness or intimacy, while men use touch as a means to control or indicate power.</li>\n<li>Intimate interactions can convey as much emotion as facial expressions.</li>\n<li><em>Paralanguage</em>: all vocal cues other than the content of the verbal message itself.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Algeria, Chad, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia.</li>\n<li><em>Endogamy</em>: the tendency for people to marry within their own social group.</li>\n<li>Endogamy appears to be declining with the rise of interracial marriages.</li>\n<li><em>Homogamy</em>: the tendency for people to marry others who have similar personal characteristics.</li>\n<li>Marital partners tend to be similar in age, education, physical attractiveness, attitudes and values, marital history, and even vulnerability to psychological disorders.</li>\n<li>Homogamy is associated with longer-lasting and more satisfying marital relations.</li>\n<li>Women tend to place a higher value than men on potential partners’ socioeconomic status, intelligence, ambition, and financial prospects.</li>\n<li>In contrast, men consistently

stability.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Personality</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research has found that personality isn’t a strong predictor of marital success.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Premarital communication</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The degree to which couples get along during their courtship is predictive of their marital adjustment.</li>\n<li>The quality of premarital communication appears to be especially crucial.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stressful events</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research has found that stress from work can spill over to affect the mood at home, which can erode a marriage.</li>\n<li>One exception to the stress link with marriage is related to becoming new parents.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There are predictable patterns of development for families, just as there are for individuals.</li>\n<li><em>Family life cycle</em>: an orderly sequence of developmental stages that families tend to progress through.</li>\n<li>Marriage creates an entirely new family.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Six-stage family development model</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Between families: The unattached young adult</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This stage is when people are single/dating.</li>\n<li>More people are prolonging this stage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The joining of families through marriage: The newly married couple</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the unattached adult becomes attached.</li>\n<li>While this phase can be quite troublesome, in general, this stage tends to be characterized by great happiness.</li>\n<li>Spouses’ satisfaction with their relationship tends to be relatively high early in marriage, before the arrival of the first child.</li>\n<li>A family that decides to be childless has become more popular in recent decades.</li>\n<li>Couples who choose to remain childless cite the great costs incurred in raising children.</li>\n<li>Although voluntary childlessness is becoming more common, such couples are still in the minority as most couples decide to have children.</li>\n<li>The vast majority of parents rate parenthood as a positive and satisfying experience and report no regret about their choice.</li>\n<li>Similarly, most voluntarily childless couples don’t regret their choice either.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The family with young children</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The arrival of the first child represents a major transition and the disruption of routines can be emotionally draining.</li>\n<li>The transition to parenthood tends to have more impact on mothers than fathers.</li>\n<li>The key to making this transition less stressful may be to have realistic expectations about parental responsibilities.</li>\n<li>Although children stress test a marriage, divorce rates are clearly higher for those who remain childless.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The family with adolescents</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Studies show that parents rate adolescence as the most difficult stage of parenthood.</li>\n<li>However, problematic parent-teen relationships appear to be the exception rather than the rule.</li>\n<li>Parents seem to learn from their experience in dealing with an adolescent child, as they report less conflict with their second adolescent child than their first.</li>\n<li><em>Sandwich generation</em>: when adults are caught between caring for their aging parents and caring for their adolescent child.</li>\n<li>Thanks to improvements in healthcare and technology, today’s average married couple has more parents than children.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launching children and moving on</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When children begin to reach their twenties, the family has to adapt to many exits and entries, as children leave and return, sometimes with their spouses.</li>\n<li>In many instances, conflict subsides and parent-child relations become closer and more supportive.</li>\n<li>Most parents adjust effectively to the empty nest transition, and the empty nest is associated with improved mood and well-being for most mothers.</li>\n<li>In fact, problems arise if children return to the once-empty nest, especially if these returns are frequent.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The family in later life</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marital satisfaction tends to climb in the post-parental period as couples find that they have more time to devote attention to each other.</li>\n<li>Older couples rate children/grandchildren, good memories, and traveling together as the top three sources of pleasure.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>All couples encounter problems, but successful marriages depend on couples’ ability to handle their problems.</li>\n<li>Traditional role expectations used to be clear and inflexible, with the husband’s domain as the working world and the woman’s domain as the home.</li>\n<li>However, modern times have shifted this expectation and modern couples need to negotiate and renegotiate role responsibilities throughout the family life cycle.</li>\n<li>Research shows that husbands’ careers continue to take priority over their wives’ ambitions.</li>\n<li>E.g. Wives are expected to interrupt their career to raise young children, stay home when children are sick, and abandon their jobs when husbands’ careers require relocation.</li>\n<li>Although men’s contribution to housework has increased in recent decades, wives are still doing the bulk of household chores.</li>\n<li>E.g. Wives still handle core housework such as cooking, cleaning, and laundry, while men still handle yard work or auto maintenance.</li>\n<li>Interestingly, men who have lived independently for longer are more egalitarian in their views about housework.</li>\n<li>It’s imperative that couples discuss role expectations in depth before marriage and to find if their views are divergent.</li>\n<li>Both husbands and wives struggle to balance the demands of work and family, and for both, work-family conflict is associated with reduced life satisfaction and quality of marriage.</li>\n<li>There’s little evidence that a mother working a job is harmful to her children.</li>\n<li>Conflicts regarding how to spend money are common and are potentially damaging at all income levels.</li>\n<li>Happy couples engage in more joint decision making on finances, so the best way to avoid troublesome battles over money is to communicate.</li>\n<li>Effective communication is crucial to the success of a marriage and is consistently associated with increased marital satisfaction.</li>\n<li>Research supports the idea that marital adjustment depends not on whether there is conflict, but rather how that conflict is handled when it does occur.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Communication problems in unhappy married couples</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Difficult to convey positive messages</li>\n<li>Misunderstand each other more often</li>\n<li>Less likely to recognize that they’ve been misunderstood</li>\n<li>Use more frequent and more intense negative messages</li>\n<li>Differ in the amount of self-disclosure they prefer in the relationship</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Unhappy couples tend to get caught up in escalating cycles of conflict from which they can’t escape, whereas happy couples find ways to exit the cycle.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four horsemen of the divorce apocalypse</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Contempt</em>: communicating insulting feelings that one’s spouse is inferior.</li>\n<li><em>Criticism</em>: constantly expressing negative evaluations of one’s partner.</li>\n<li><em>Defensiveness</em>: responding to contempt and criticism by invalidating, refuting, or denying the partner’s statements.</li>\n<li><em>Stonewalling</em>: refusing to listen to one’s partner, especially their complaints.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Divorce</em>: the legal dissolution of a marriage.</li>\n<li>People appear to vary in their threshold for divorce, just as they do in their threshold for marriage.</li>\n<li>Typically, divorce is the culmination of a gradual disintegration of the relationship brought about by an accumulation of interrelated problems, which often date back to the beginning of a couple’s relationship.</li>\n<li>Although most people realize that divorce rates are high, they have a curious tendency to underestimate the likelihood that they’ll personally experience a divorce.</li>\n<li>The vast majority of divorces happen in the first ten years of marriage.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reasons for divorce</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communication difficulties</li>\n<li>Infidelity</li>\n<li>Jealousy</li>\n<li>Growing apart</li>\n<li>Foolish spending behavior</li>\n<li>Substance abuse</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Divorces are often postponed repeatedly and is usually the outcome of a long series of smaller decisions that may take years to unfold.</li>\n<li>Wives initiate two-thirds of divorce proceedings and tend to have a better judgment about the chance of their marriage ending in divorce.</li>\n<li>Objectively speaking, divorce appears to be more difficult and disruptive for women than for men, especially in terms of finances.</li>\n<li>However, the negative effects on former spouses’ psychological adjustment are about the same for men and women.</li>\n<li>The impact of divorce on children isn’t well understood and there are conflicting conclusions from research.</li>\n<li>Overall, the weight of evidence suggests that divorce tends to have harmful effects on many children, but can have beneficial effects if the parents’ relationship was dominated by conflict.</li>\n<li>About 75% of divorced people eventually remarry with the average time between divorce and remarriage to be three to four years.</li>\n<li>Studies suggest that second marriages are slightly less successful than first marriages.</li>\n<li>However, if you consider that in this pool of people all the first marriages ran into serious trouble, then the second marriages look better in comparison.</li>\n<li>Evidence suggests that on average, stepfamilies appears to be somewhat less cohesive and warm than interaction in first-marriage families.</li>\n<li>Skimming the part on alternative/non-traditional relationship lifestyles.</li>\n<li>The pressure to marry is substantial in our society and about 88% of single respondents agreed with the desire to get married someday.</li>\n<li>The most probable reason for the increase in the proportion of young people who are single is due to the median age at which people get married has increased.</li>\n<li>Recent years have seen a great rise in the number of cohabiting couples.</li>\n<li>As a prelude to marriage, cohabitation should allow people to experiment with marital-like responsibilities and reduce the likelihood of entering marriage with unrealistic expectations.</li>\n<li>However, research hasn’t found that premarital cohabitation increases the likelihood of subsequent marital success.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intimate partner violence can take many forms</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Psychological</li>\n<li>Emotional</li>\n<li>Physical</li>\n<li>Sexual</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Violence arises due to anger, the need for power, sadism, jealousy, unrealistic expectations, or blame.</li>\n<li>We shouldn’t focus on why women stay in abusive relationships, but rather why men batter and abuse women in the first place.</li>\n<li>In reality, research indicates that most victims are raped by someone they know.</li>\n<li>It’s no surprise that alcohol contributes to about half of sexually aggressive incidents.</li>\n<li>Alcohol impairs judgment and reduces inhibitions, making people more willing to use force.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-11-gender-and-behavior\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a

male or female.</li>\n<li>Anatomical differences between the two genders leads people to expect other differences as well.</li>\n<li>A survey of gender stereotypes in 25 countries revealed considerable similarity of views.</li>\n<li>Within America, gender stereotypes have remained largely stable since the early 1970s even though there have been many changes to American women’s ability to gain education and occupation.</li>\n<li>The stereotypes for males generally reflect the quality of instrumentality, whereas the stereotypes for females generally reflect the quality of expressiveness.</li>\n<li><em>Instrumentality</em>: an orientation toward action and accomplishment.</li>\n<li><em>Expressiveness</em>: an orientation toward emotion and relationships.</li>\n<li>Since the 1980s, the boundaries between male and female stereotypes have become more flexible and people now perceive gender as a continuum as opposed to a dichotomy.</li>\n<li><em>Androcentrism</em>: the belief that the male is the norm.</li>\n<li>Androcentrism results in the view that male stereotypes are more positive and complimentary, whereas the female stereotype is more negative and critical.</li>\n<li>E.g. “He has attention to detail” versus “She’s picky.”\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto;

differences is in spatial abilities such as perceiving and mentally manipulating shapes and figures.</li>\n<li>Males typically outperform females in most spatial abilities and this gender gap is relatively large and has been repeatedly found.</li>\n<li>For personality traits, females tend to score lower on self-esteem and males tend to score higher on physical aggression.</li>\n<li>Males are

often than women.</li>\n<li>Females are more likely to develop PTSD due to experiencing trauma at a younger age than males.</li>\n<li>We should be cautious when interpreting gender differences as these are group studies that tell us nothing about individuals.</li>\n<li>E.g. We’re comparing the “average man” to the “average woman”.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, we should remember that these group differences are relatively small.</li>\n<li>Ultimately, the similarities between women and men greatly outweigh the differences.</li>\n<li>Statistical analysis also suggests that these differences are often the result of factors other than gender.</li>\n<li><em>Social role theory</em>: asserts that minor gender differences are exaggerated by the different social roles that each gender occupies.</li>\n<li>Males are more sexually active and permissive because they invest less in the process of procreation, but they’re also more aggressive due to having more competition for sexual partners.</li>\n<li>However, we should be careful about using evolution as the cause of gender differences because evolution can be used to explain almost anything.</li>\n<li>While there are some small differences between male and female brains, the brain are more similar than different and the differences may be a result of the environment.</li>\n<li>Findings suggest that prenatal hormones shape gender differences in humans but the conclusions aren’t strong nor clear.</li>\n<li>Overall evidence suggests that biological factors such as evolution, brain structure, and hormones play a minor role in gender differences.</li>\n<li><em>Socialization</em>: the acquisition of norms and roles expected of people in a particular society.</li>\n<li>Like other roles, gender roles are acquired through socialization.</li>\n<li>How to people acquire gender roles?</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three main learning processes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Reinforcement and punishment</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teachers and peers often reinforce gender-appropriate behavior with compliments or criticism.</li>\n<li>Most parents don’t go out of their way to reward it, but instead are much less tolerant of gender-inappropriate behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Observational learning</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Young children often copy the behavior of a parent or older sibling.</li>\n<li>Children also are more likely to copy people that are nurturant, powerful, and similar to themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Self-socialization</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Self-socialization begins when children link the gender schema for their own gender to their self-concept.</li>\n<li>In this way, children discover the rules that are supposed to govern their behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four major sources of gender-role messages</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Parents</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There’s a strong tendency for both mothers and fathers to emphasize and encourage play activities that are gender appropriate.</li>\n<li>E.g. Cars toys for boys and dollhouses for girls.</li>\n<li>Generally, boys have less leeway to play with feminine toys than girls do with masculine toys.</li>\n<li>Boys are under more pressure than girls to behave in gender-appropriate ways.</li>\n<li>Parents tend to respond negatively to gender inappropriate behavior, especially in boys.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Peers</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Between ages 4 and 6, children tend to separate into same-gender groups on their own.</li>\n<li>Both boys and girls are critical of peers who violate traditional gender norms.</li>\n<li>E.g. Boys dressing up as girls or girls playing like boys.</li>\n<li>Girls play in smaller groups and boys in larger groups.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Schools</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subtle word choices in books and textbooks can reinforce stereotypes.</li>\n<li>Gender bias also shows up in teachers’ treatment of boys and girls and in academic and career counseling.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Media</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TV is another source of gender-role socialization.</li>\n<li>Shows and commercials reinforce gender stereotypes with their choice of actors and the roles they play.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Five key attributes of the traditional male role</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Achievement</li>\n<li>Aggression</li>\n<li>Autonomy</li>\n<li>Sexuality</li>\n<li>Stoicism</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Skimming over the problems with the male and female role.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three key attributes that have changed for the traditional female role</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Marriage mandate</li>\n<li>Motherhood mandate</li>\n<li>Work outside the home</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>In Western society, gender roles are in a state of transition.</li>\n<li>E.g. Less than 100 years ago, women weren’t allowed to vote and it was unheard of for a woman to initiate a date.</li>\n<li>One reason why gender roles are changing is because traditional gender roles no longer make economic sense.</li>\n<li>E.g. The widespread use of machines to do work has rendered physical strength relatively unimportant.</li>\n<li>The future is likely to bring even more dramatic shifts in gender roles.</li>\n<li>E.g. As women become more economically independent, they’ll have less need to get married for economic reasons.</li>\n<li><em>Gender-role transcendence perspectives</em>: proposes that to be fully human, people need to move beyond gender roles as a way of organizing their perceptions of themselves and others.</li>\n<li>This perspective argues that we should dispense with the artificially constructed gender categories and labels altogether.</li>\n<li>E.g. Using gender-neutral terms such as “instrumental” and “expressive” to describe personality traits and behaviors.</li>\n<li>Men are more likely to use an “instrumental” style of communication, whereas women use an “expressive” style.</li>\n<li><em>Instrumental style</em>: focuses on reaching practical goals and finding solutions.</li>\n<li><em>Expressive style</em>: focuses on expressing emotions and being sensitive to others’ feelings.</li>\n<li>However, the social context is a much stronger influence on behavior than gender, which means people use either style depending on the situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-12-development-and-expression-of-sexuality\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-12-development-and-expression-of-sexuality\" aria-label=\"chapter 12 development and expression of sexuality permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 12: Development and Expression of Sexuality</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>People vary greatly in how they express their sexuality.</li>\n<li>We should be cautious of sex research because it depends on self reporting, people who answer tend to be more liberal and more sexually experienced, and because it’s difficult to get representative samples.</li>\n<li><em>Sexual identity</em>: the set of personal qualities, self-perceptions, attitudes, values, and preferences that guide one’s sexual behavior.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four key features of sexual identity</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Sexual orientation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and asexual.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Body image</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A positive body image is correlated with greater sexual activity, higher sexual satisfaction, and fewer sexual problems.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sexual values and ethics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Absolutism (no sex outside of marriage), relativism (relationship determines appropriate sexual activities), and hedonism (anything goes).</li>\n<li>Is culture-specific.</li>\n<li>E.g. Our double standard encourages sexual experimentation in males but not in females.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Erotic preferences</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People differ in what they find enjoyable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Review of sexual differentiation, hormones, gonads, androgens, and estrogens.</li>\n<li>At puberty, hormones reassert their influence on sexual development.</li>\n<li><em>Primary sex characteristics</em>: the structures necessary for reproduction.</li>\n<li><em>Secondary sex characteristics</em>: physical features that aid in distinguishing genders but aren’t directly involved in reproduction.</li>\n<li>Androgen levels appear to be related to sexual motivation in both men and women, although the effect is less strong in women.</li>\n<li>E.g. High levels of testosterone in men and women correlate with higher rates of sexual activity.</li>\n<li>Interestingly, estrogen levels don’t correlate well with sexual interest.</li>\n<li>Similar to gender-role socialization, sexual identity is shaped by one’s family, peers, schools, religion, and media.</li>\n<li>Parents who make sex a taboo topic reduce their influence on their kids’ evolving sexual identity, as the children turn elsewhere for information.</li>\n<li>Friends are a leading source of relationship and sexual information but peers can also be a source of misleading information.</li>\n<li>The religious message of not having sex until marriage is largely ineffective, as teen who take these pledges tend to be just as sexually active as their non-pledging peers.</li>\n<li>Findings suggest that although religious teaching might affect sexual attitudes, they don’t always influence behavior.</li>\n<li>The portrayal of sexual content in the media appears to be on the rise, with more TV shows and music containing sexual content.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gender differences in sexual socialization</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Men have more interest in sex than women.</li>\n<li>The connection between sex and intimacy is more important for women than for men.</li>\n<li>Aggression is more often linked to sexuality for men than for women.</li>\n<li>Women’s sexuality is more easily shaped by cultural and situational factors.</li>\n<li>Among heterosexual couples, men typically take the lead in initiating sexual intimacy, while women serve as gatekeeps.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For both genders, sexual satisfaction is related to relationship satisfaction.</li>\n<li>It’s more accurate to view heterosexuality and homosexuality on a continuum because many people who say they’re straight have had homosexual experiences.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Components of sexual orientation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sexual attraction</li>\n<li>Romantic attraction</li>\n<li>Sexual behavior</li>\n<li>Sexual identity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There’s no consensus among researchers as to why some people are straight and why others are gay.</li>\n<li>Researchers have found that extremely feminine behavior in young boys and masculine behavior in young girls is correlated with subsequent homosexuality.</li>\n<li>Twin studies have provided further support for the conclusion that heredity influences sexual orientation.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block;

experienced a friends-with-benefits relationship.</li>\n<li>Among committed relationships, sexual intimacy is a positive predictor of relationship stability.</li>\n<li>On average, couples in their 20s

A person doesn’t treat patient but is a doctor. A person doesn’t practice the law but is a lawyer. A person doesn’t write code but is a programmer.</li>\n<li><em>Industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology</em>: the study of human behavior in the workplace.</li>\n<li>The way workers view their jobs is strongly related to their income.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Drug use that leads to addiction. Drug use itself isn’t unusual or deviant but the addiction is.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Personal distress</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diagnosis is frequently based on an individual’s report of great personal distress.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Constantly worrying about yesterday’s mistakes and tomorrow’s problems, and they worry about how much they worry.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Phobic</em>: marked by a persistent and irrational fear of an object or situation that presents no realistic danger.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Fear of snow.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Obsessive-compulsive (OCD)</em>: marked by persistent, uncontrollable intrusions of unwanted thoughts/obsessions and urges to engage in senseless rituals/compulsions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Having a three-page memo on how to open cans of fruit to prevent germs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Panic</em>: marked by recurrent attacks of overwhelming anxiety that usually occur suddenly and unexpectedly with physical symptoms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g.

Faster thinking generally leads to a more positive mood and vice versa.</li>\n<li>Being placed in a positive mood has been shown to make people more creative.</li>\n<li><em>Positive emotions</em>: pleasant responses to events that promote connections with others.</li>\n<li>E.g. Happiness, joy, euphoria, gratitude, and contentment.</li>\n<li>Positive emotions open people up to a variety of new behavioral options.</li>\n<li><em>Flow</em>: the state of being where a person becomes fully involved and engaged in the present by some interesting, challenging, and rewarding activity.</li>\n<li>We can think of flow as an optimal state as people in it become less self-aware, lose track of time, and focus their energy and attention on doing something engaging.</li>\n<li>Flow is characterized as a balance between a person’s current skill level and the challenges of the situation.</li>\n<li>Thus, to find flow, you must find a challenging activity that matches your skill level.</li>\n<li>When skills are properly matched to an activity’s level of challenge, flow occurs naturally.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;
