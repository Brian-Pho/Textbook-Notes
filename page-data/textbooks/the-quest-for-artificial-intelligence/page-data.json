we can apparently only hold seven of them (plus or minus two) in our immediate memory.</li>\n<li>Cognitive science attempted to explicate internal mental processes using ideas such as goals, memory, task queues, and strategies without necessarily trying to ground these processes in neurophysiology.</li>\n<li>Cognitive science and artificial intelligence have been closely related ever since their beginnings.</li>\n<li>Cognitive science has provided clues for AI researchers, and AI has helped cognitive science with newly invented concepts useful for understanding the workings of the mind.</li>\n<li>\n<p>That living things evolve gives us two more clues about how to build intelligent artifacts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, the processes of evolution itself might be simulated on computers to produce the machines we dream about.</li>\n<li>Second, those paths that evolution followed in producing increasingly intelligent animals can be used as a guide for creating increasingly intelligent artifacts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>That each descendant machine differed little from its parent, whereas any helpful improvement would require a much larger step in the “space” of possible machines.</li>\n<li>Researchers would come to recognize that all of these evolutionary methods were elaborations of a useful mathematical search strategy called “gradient ascent” or “hill climbing.”</li>\n<li>Start with a machine that is able to do what an infant can do, then design machines that can mimic the abilities of children at each rung of the ladder.</li>\n<li>It may be that an infant mind is far too complicated to simulate and the processes of its maturation too difficult to follow.</li>\n<li>If the aspect of behavior that is fed back acts to diminish or reverse that aspect, the process is called “negative feedback.”</li>\n<li>If, on the other hand, it acts to increase or accentuate that aspect of behavior, it is called “positive feedback.”</li>\n<li>That self-organization is not a property of an organism itself but a property of the organism and its environment taken together.</li>\n<li>Although self-organization appears to be important in ideas about how life originated, it’s unclear whether or not it provides clues for building intelligent machines.</li>\n<li>Storing the program allows changes in the program to be made easily, but it also allows the program to change itself by changing appropriate parts of the memory where the program is stored.</li>\n<li>The importance of the universal machine is clear. We don’t need to have an infinite number of different machines doing different jobs. A single one will suffice.</li>\n<li>The engineering problem of producing various machines for various jobs is replaced by the office work of ‘programming’ the universal machine to do these jobs.</li>\n<li>Argument from Continuity in the Nervous System: The nervous system is certainly not a discrete-state machine. A small error in the information about the size of a nervous impulse impinging on a neuron may make a large difference to the size of the outgoing impulse.</li>\n<li>It may be argued that one cannot expect to be able to mimic the behavior of the nervous system with a discrete-state system.</li>\n<li>Alan Turing suggested “Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child’s? If this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"part-ii-early-explorations-1950s-and-1960s\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#part-ii-early-explorations-1950s-and-1960s\" aria-label=\"part ii early explorations 1950s and 1960s permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Part II: Early Explorations: 1950s and 1960s</h2>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-3-gatherings\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-3-gatherings\" aria-label=\"chapter 3 gatherings permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 3: Gatherings</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If machines are to become intelligent, they must be able to do the thinking-related things that humans can do.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The emergence of artificial intelligence as a full-fledged area of research coincided with three important meetings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>one in 1955,</li>\n<li>one in 1956, and</li>\n<li>one in 1958.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In 1955, a “Session on Learning Machines” was held in Los Angeles.</li>\n<li>1955: To “come to the same thing,” these two approaches, neural modeling and symbol processing, must be recognized simply as different levels of description of what goes on in the brain. Different levels are appropriate for describing different kinds of mental phenomena.</li>\n<li>In 1956 a “Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence” was convened at Dartmouth College.</li>\n<li>1956: The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.</li>\n<li>The 1956 workshop is considered to be the official beginning of serious work in artificial intelligence, and Minsky, McCarthy, Newell, and Simon came to be regarded as the “fathers” of AI.</li>\n<li>1958: The proceedings of this conference contains some papers that became quite in influential in the history of artificial intelligence.</li>\n<li>Pandemonium can take the form of a neural network, a hierarchically organized set of symbol processors all working in parallel, or some combination of these forms. If the latter, the model is a provocative proposal for joining these two disparate approaches to AI.</li>\n<li>These are computational processes that “look at” the input data, say an image of a printed letter or number. Each demon looks for something specific in the image, perhaps a horizontal bar; another might look for a vertical bar; another for an arc of a circle; and so on.</li>\n<li>Each demon “shouts” its findings to a set of demons higher in the organization. (Think of these higher level demons as middle-level managers.) The loudness of a demon’s shout depends on how certain it’s that it’s seeing what it’s looking for.</li>\n<li>Each of the next level of demons specializes in listening for a particular combination of shouts from the data demons.</li>\n<li>E.g. One of the demons at this level might be tuned to listen for shouts from data demon 3, data demon 11, and data demon 22. If it finds that these particular demons are shouting loudly, it responds with a shout of its own to the demons one level up in the hierarchy, and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-4-pattern-recognition\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-4-pattern-recognition\" aria-label=\"chapter 4 pattern recognition permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 4: Pattern Recognition</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Their work benefitted from introspection about how humans solve problems.</li>\n<li>Many of our mental abilities are beyond our power of introspection.</li>\n<li>We don’t know how we recognize speech sounds, read cursive script, distinguish a cup from a plate, or identify faces.

For both speech and text, morphology deals with how whole words are put together from smaller parts.</li>\n<li>E.g.

It was an early example of the importation of probabilistic representations and associated computational methods into AI.</li>\n<li>DRAGON combined these separate levels into a network consisting of a hierarchy of probabilistic functions of Markov processes.</li>\n<li>Entities representing segments of the speech waveform were at the bottom, entities representing phones were in the middle, and entities representing words were at the top. At each level, Bayes’s rule was used to compute probabilities of the x’s given the y’s.</li>\n<li>Because only the speech waveform at the bottom level was actually observed, the phones and words were said to be “hidden.” For this reason, the entire network employed hidden Markov models (HMMs).</li>\n<li>DRAGON was the first example of the use of HMMs in AI.</li>\n<li>The transcription of spoken sentences to their textual equivalents is now largely a solved problem.</li>\n<li>E.g. High-quality speech recognition is commonly employed today in many automated telephone response systems.</li>\n<li>However, understanding natural language remains a long-term research problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-18-consulting-systems\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-18-consulting-systems\" aria-label=\"chapter 18 consulting systems permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 18: Consulting Systems</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>It became common to divide the program into two parts, namely, the “inference engine” for applying rules and the “knowledge base” of rules.</li>\n<li>In principle, new rules could be added without having to change the inference engine.</li>\n<li>This separation suggests that one could construct expert systems for other applications simply by replacing the medical knowledge with some other knowledge base without having to change the inference engine.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-19-understanding-queries-and-signals\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-19-understanding-queries-and-signals\" aria-label=\"chapter 19 understanding queries and signals permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 19: Understanding Queries and Signals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Although one can describe generally the problems one is trying to solve, one can’t describe (ahead of time) what the solutions are going to be.</li>\n<li>As exploratory research progresses, new problems become apparent, so one can’t even describe all the problems ahead of time.

what they called “Fifth Generation Computer Systems” (FGCS).</li>\n<li>Its goal was to produce computers that could perform AI-style inferences from large data and knowledge bases and communicate with humans using natural language.</li>\n<li>“Fifth Generation” was meant to emphasize dramatic progress beyond previous “generations” of computer technology.</li>\n<li>The first generation, developed during and after World War II, used vacuum tubes.</li>\n<li>Around 1959, transistors replaced vacuum tubes giving rise to the second generation.</li>\n<li>During the 1960s, transistors and other components were fabricated on single silicon wafer “chips,” and the several chips comprising a computer were connected together by wires.</li>\n<li>Computers using this so-called small-scale integration (SSI) technology comprised the third generation.</li>\n<li>In the late 1970s, entire microprocessors could be put on a single chip using “large-scale integration” technology the fourth generation.</li>\n<li>The Japanese fifth generation was to involve many parallel processors using “ultra large-scale integration”.</li>\n<li>Many observers think that most of the results of the FGCS project are now of historical interest only.

Alan Turing anticipated some of their objections in his 1950 paper.</li>\n<li>In this chapter, I’ll recount some of the controversies surrounding AI.</li>\n<li>No one supposes that computer simulations of a fire will burn the neighborhood down or that a computer simulation of a rainstorm will leave us all drenched.</li>\n<li>Why suppose that a computer simulation of understanding actually understood anything?</li>\n<li>For simulation, all you need is the right input and output and a program in the middle that transforms the former into the latter.</li>\n<li>To confuse simulation with duplication is the same mistake.</li>\n<li>The meaning of a term is represented by its place in the network and how it’s connected to other terms. This same idea is used in dictionaries where the meaning of a word is given by mentioning the relationship of this word to other words.</li>\n<li>The meanings of those other words are given by their relationships to yet other words. So we can think of a dictionary as being like a large semantic network of words linked to other words.</li>\n<li>“We don’t know the equations describing the physical processes in the brain, and even if we did, the solution of the equations describing the simplest reaction would take a prohibitive amount of time.”</li>\n<li>“Significant developments in artificial intelligence must await an entirely different sort of computer. The only existing prototype for it’s the little-understood human brain.”</li>\n<li>In addition to concerns about AI’s overstated claims, many computer scientists thought AI to be a kind of fringe activity that did not adhere to rigorous scientific standards.</li>\n<li>Concern for “respectability” has had a stultifying effect on some AI researchers. I hear them saying things like, “AI used to be criticized for its flossiness. Now that we have made solid progress, let us not risk losing our respectability.”</li>\n<li>One result of this conservatism has been increased concentration on “weak AI” and away from “strong AI”.</li>\n<li>This is too bad because although I think the goals of weak AI are important and worthy, building an artifact that mimics the abilities of the human brain would be a tremendous scientific achievement.</li>\n<li>One of the reasons why expert systems are brittle is that they lack “common sense.”</li>\n<li>In addition to the expert knowledge that humans might acquire through education and professional experience, they also have a lot of general knowledge.</li>\n<li>E.g. That only females can become pregnant, that umbrellas protect against sun and rain, that certain birds migrate, that food can be purchased in markets, and millions upon millions of other facts.</li>\n<li>“Commonsense knowledge is knowledge about the structure of the external world that is acquired and applied without concentrated effort by any normal human that allows him or her to meet the everyday demands of the physical, spatial, temporal and social environment with a reasonable degree of success.”</li>\n<li>It seems that the knowledge of any particular human should be thought of as an ever-growing tree whose base and lower branches comprise “common sense” and whose upper ramifications comprise the “expertise” of specialized disciplines that the person might have learned.</li>\n<li>The tree metaphor is also useful in emphasizing the point that the knowledge in the upper branches uses concepts that occur in the trunk and lower branches.</li>\n<li>During the early 1980s, many AI sponsors had greatly inflated expectations of what AI could do.</li>\n<li>Undoubtedly, some of the blame for their unjustified optimism could be placed on AI researchers themselves who were motivated to make exaggerated promises.</li>\n<li>The failure to deliver systems matching these unrealistic hopes, together with the accumulating critical commentary that I have already mentioned, combined in the mid to late 1980s to bring on what came to be called an “AI winter.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-25-controversies-and-alternative-paradigms\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-25-controversies-and-alternative-paradigms\" aria-label=\"chapter 25 controversies and alternative paradigms permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 25: Controversies and Alternative Paradigms</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Frustrated with AI’s slowdown, people with different approaches to AI eagerly stepped forward to claim that what AI needed was more of this or that alternative to AI’s reigning paradigm “good-old-fashioned AI” or GOFAI.</li>\n<li>GOFAI had as its primary rationale the belief that a “physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action.” But GOFAI seemed to be running out of steam during the 1980s, making it vulnerable to challenges by AI researchers themselves.</li>\n<li>Another objection to the use of logical representations was based on the fact that logical sentences must be either true or false whereas so much of human knowledge is uncertain.</li>\n<li>The brain’s functions simply aren’t based on any small set of principles. Instead, they’re based on hundreds or perhaps even thousands of them.</li>\n<li>In other words, the brain is what engineers call a kludge, a jury-rigged solution to a problem, accomplished by adding bits of machinery wherever needed, without any general, overall plan.</li>\n<li>The result is that the human mind should be regarded as a collection of kludges. The evidence for this is perfectly clear: If you look at the index of any large textbook of neuroscience, you’ll see that a human brain has many hundreds of parts - that is, subcomputers - that do different things.</li>\n<li>Why do our brains need so many parts? Surely, if our minds were based on only a few basic principles, we wouldn’t need so much complexity.</li>\n<li>Just because the brain is a kludge does not mean that computer intelligences have to be.</li>\n<li>Nevertheless, some AI researchers favored systems consisting of collections of experimentally derived, ad hoc routines designed to solve specific problems. These people called themselves “scruffies” to distinguish themselves from the “neats” who favored programs based on theoretically based principles.</li>\n<li>Because apparently the brain does what it does by massive parallel computations implemented by networks of interconnected neurons, some people began anew to explore the possibilities of neural networks.</li>\n<li>During the late 1970s a group at the University of California at San Diego headed by cognitive psychologists David E.

If one could prove a statement from a given knowledge base, one could still prove that same statement when more knowledge is added.</li>\n<li>Yet, much human reasoning does not seem to work that way. Often, we jump to a conclusion using the facts we happen to have, together with reasonable assumptions, and then have to retract that conclusion when we learn some new fact that contradicts the assumptions.</li>\n<li>That style of reasoning is called nonmonotonic or defeasible (meaning “capable of being made or declared null and void”) because new facts might require taking back something concluded before.</li>\n<li>We humans are also able to predict, with useful accuracies, the future course of many of the physical processes we commonly experience.</li>\n<li>E.g. When people play in ocean waves at the beach, they are usually able to predict when a wave crest will arrive so that they can jump up in time. Do our brains use anything like the equation just shown to make that prediction? Probably not.</li>\n<li>Instead, prediction routines for guiding skilled actions are learned by repeated experiences and are part of what psychologists call “procedural knowledge.”</li>\n<li>In addition to acting automatically and effectively using procedural knowledge embedded in our various motor skills, we can also make declarative statements predicting what will happen in certain situations.</li>\n<li>E.g. A surfer looking out at incoming waves can tell a friend “Take the next wave; it’s going to be a big one.”</li>\n<li>Apparently we have some facility for representing and using “qualitative knowledge” about physical processes - knowledge that is neither part of our procedural “muscle memory” nor represented in our brains by complex mathematical formulas.</li>\n<li>E.g. How do we know that when we knock over a glass of water on a table the water will eventually come to the edge of the table and spill off? How do we know that if we stack heavy boxes on top of light, fragile boxes, the fragile boxes might collapse? How do we know that if we drive to our destination a little bit faster, we’ll get there a little bit sooner?</li>\n<li>Earlier in AI’s history there was controversy about whether knowledge should be represented by data structures such as semantic networks or by sets of logical statements.</li>\n<li>Gradually the controversy moderated because researchers came to accept the idea that semantic networks could be thought of as a special way of representing certain kinds of logical statements, thereby permitting some deductions to be made directly from the network.</li>\n<li>Decided to undertake the immense task of providing computers with common-sense knowledge. The first step, he thought, would be to “prime the pump with the millions of everyday terms, concepts, facts, and rules of thumb” that comprise common sense.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-27-other-approaches-to-reasoning-and-representation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-27-other-approaches-to-reasoning-and-representation\" aria-label=\"chapter 27 other approaches to reasoning and representation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 27: Other Approaches to Reasoning and Representation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>No notes because it wasn’t interesting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-28-bayesian-networks\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-28-bayesian-networks\" aria-label=\"chapter 28 bayesian networks permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 28: Bayesian Networks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Much human reasoning is about propositions and quantities that are uncertain.

An agent’s knowledge consists of a set of propositions. Because of possible interdependencies among the propositions, accurate probabilistic reasoning depends on knowing more than just the probability of each of those propositions individually. Instead, probability values for various combinations of the propositions taken together, called “joint probabilities,” are usually required; this leads, in the general case, to impractically large representations and intractable computations.</li>\n<li>One thing that all of these applications has taught us is the importance of massive amounts of data, which has turned out to be the major theme of modern AI.</li>\n<li>The fact that full explanations involve rather complex mathematics testifies again to the great increase in AI’s technical depth that began in the 1980s.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-29-machine-learning\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-29-machine-learning\" aria-label=\"chapter 29 machine learning permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 29: Machine Learning</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Most machine learning methods construct hypotheses from data.</li>\n<li>E.g. If a large set of data contains several instances of swans being white and no instances of swans being of other colors, then a machine learning algorithm might make the inference that “all swans are white.”</li>\n<li>Such an inference is “inductive” rather than “deductive.” Deductive inferences follow necessarily and logically from their premisses, whereas inductive ones are hypotheses, which are always subject to falsification by additional data.</li>\n<li>Still, inductive inferences, based on large amounts of data, are extremely useful. Indeed, science itself is based on inductive inferences.</li>\n<li>The usual AI approach to dealing with large quantities of data is to reduce the amount of it in some way.</li>\n<li>E.g. A neural network is able to represent what is important about a large amount of training data by the network’s structure and weight values. Similarly, learning a Bayesian network from data condenses these data into the network’s node structure and its conditional probability tables.</li>\n<li>The basic idea behind backprop is simple, but the mathematics is complicated.</li>\n<li>In response to an error in the network’s output, backprop makes small adjustments in all of the weights so as to reduce that error. It can be regarded as a hill-climbing (or rather hill-descending) method - searching for low values of error over the landscape of weights.</li>\n<li>But rather than actually trying out all possible small weight changes and deciding on that set of them that corresponds to the steepest descent downhill, backprop uses calculus to pre-compute the best set of weight changes.</li>\n<li>The decision tree and neural network learning methods described so far are examples of “supervised learning”, a type of learning in which one attempts to learn to classify data from a large sample of training data whose classifications are known.</li>\n<li>The “supervision” that directs learning in these systems involves informing the system about the classification of each datum in the training set.</li>\n<li>Yet, it’s sometimes possible to construct useful classification of data based just on the data alone. Techniques for doing so fall under the heading of “unsupervised learning.”</li>\n<li>Reinforcement learning is about learning how to traverse a collection of states, going from one state to another and so on, to reach a state in which a reward is obtained.</li>\n<li>The problem is much like one that a rat faces in learning how to run a maze (or one that a robot faces in learning how to carry out a task).</li>\n<li>As in all reinforcement learning procedures, values are gradually propagated backward from the end of the game toward the starting position.</li>\n<li>To make effective decisions while navigating uncertain environments, animals must develop the ability to accurately predict the consequences of their actions. Reinforcement learning has emerged as a key theoretical paradigm for understanding how animals accomplish this feat.</li>\n<li>We want it to be such that the distances from it to the closest points of opposite categories are as large as possible. The parallel dashed lines on either side go through these closest points, which are called “support vectors.” Boundaries with margins as large as possible are desirable because they are better at classifying new points not in the training set.</li>\n<li>That is, they have better “generalizing” properties.</li>\n<li>SVMs and kernel machines are superb examples of how work in several disciplines, using highly technical mathematical apparatus, has contributed to powerful new techniques in artificial intelligence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-30-natural-languages-and-natural-scenes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-30-natural-languages-and-natural-scenes\" aria-label=\"chapter 30 natural languages and natural scenes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 30: Natural Languages and Natural Scenes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Systems that use grammars for analyzing natural language sentences must use parsing algorithms to search among candidate “parse trees” to find one or more that fits an input sentence.</li>\n<li>For realistic grammars that “accept” those word strings we think of as legal sentences and reject those strings we take to be non-sentences, it’s often the case that there are many possible parses, each conveying a different meaning.</li>\n<li>Choosing one “best” parse tree from among all of these then depends on semantic and pragmatic analyses, which take into account the context in which the sentence occurs and common-sense world knowledge.</li>\n<li>This is because people are always stretching and bending the ‘rules’ to meet their communicative needs.”</li>\n<li>This fact was recognized quite early in the study of language. The linguist and anthropologist Edward Sapir wrote “Unfortunately, or luckily, no language is tyrannically consistent. All grammars leak.</li>\n<li>Sapir meant, of course, that any grammar, no matter how complex, will accept some sentences that people find unacceptable and reject some that people find acceptable.</li>\n<li>Eugene Charniak proposed that syntactic analyses should be qualified by probabilities. Some sentences are “probably” ok, and some are probably not, and there are all gradations in between. An immediate advantage of such an approach is that the probability of a parse can be used to choose among alternative parses for ambiguous sentences.</li>\n<li>I believe that one of the potentially most promising developments in computer vision involves hierarchical models. There are different versions of these models, and different ways to construct them, but if we stand far enough back from the details, they have similar structures and features.</li>\n<li>Jeff Hawkins, the designer of the original Palm Pilot, has suggested that the neocortex is a hierarchical temporal memory whose layers (from bottom to top) store increasingly abstract representations of sensory input sequences and whose function (from top to bottom) is to make increasingly detailed predictions of future experience.</li>\n<li>He proposes that the visual cortex learns in unsupervised fashion by being subjected to sequences of images in time. Because we see images as they occur continuously in time, there are bound to be stretches in which each image is of the same object moving across our visual field - albeit appearing at different translations, scales, and orientations.</li>\n<li>This sameness provides an implicit labeling that is exploited in learning representations at all levels of the hierarchy.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, Hawkins claims the hierarchical memory and its learning procedures are used not only for visual input but for other sensory modalities as well.</li>\n<li>At the highest levels of the hierarchy these separate modalities combine to give an integrated model of our sensory world based on vision, touch, and hearing - a model we use to make predictions about what might be happening next.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-31-intelligent-system-architectures\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-31-intelligent-system-architectures\" aria-label=\"chapter 31 intelligent system architectures permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 31: Intelligent System Architectures</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Parallelism can be accomplished by either actually having several hardware processors to which programs are farmed out for execution or by the simulation of parallel operation in which the programs are actually being executed in sequence.</li>\n<li>The “reference model architecture” consists of multiple layers of “real-time control systems” developed earlier as components of a “theory of intelligence.”</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each RCS partitions the control problem into four basic elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>behavior generation (or task decomposition),</li>\n<li>world modeling,</li>\n<li>sensory processing, and</li>\n<li>value judgment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It clusters these elements into computational nodes that have responsibility for specific subsystems, and arranges these nodes in hierarchical layers such that each layer has characteristic functionality and timing.</li>\n<li>There are two types of memory modules.</li>\n<li>Declarative Memory consists of facts, such as “Washington, DC is the capital of the United States, France is a country in Europe, or 2 + 3 = 5.”</li>\n<li>Declarative knowledge is represented by units called chunks.</li>\n<li>Procedural Memory consists of production rules representing “knowledge about how we do things: for instance, knowledge about how to type the letter ‘Q’ on a keyboard, about how to drive, or about how to perform addition.”</li>\n<li>Often we are unable to verbalize our knowledge about how we do certain things: We just do them; thus knowledge about them is considered procedural, not declarative.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"part-viii-modern-ai-today-and-tomorrow\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#part-viii-modern-ai-today-and-tomorrow\" aria-label=\"part viii modern ai today and tomorrow permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Part VIII: Modern AI: Today and Tomorrow</h2>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-32-extraordinary-achievements\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-32-extraordinary-achievements\" aria-label=\"chapter 32 extraordinary achievements permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 32: Extraordinary Achievements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Does Deep Blue use artificial intelligence?</li>\n<li>The short answer is “no.”</li>\n<li>Earlier computer designs that tried to mimic human thinking weren’t good at it.

Various approaches have been pursued to gather and organize that knowledge in a form exploitable by computer programs.</li>\n<li>A third approach is to build programs that can read and understand natural language.</li>\n<li>After all, as the proponents of that approach claim, the world is full of knowledge - in books, in news feeds, and on the Web.</li>\n<li>As we have already seen, computer understanding of natural language requires both general common-sense knowledge and background knowledge about the subject matter of the text.</li>\n<li>Thus, “Learning by Reading”, as this third approach is called, draws on the technologies of knowledge representation and reasoning as well as on natural language processing.</li>\n<li>“Eye on the Prize” argued that AI researchers ought to be putting more effort into developing generally intelligent systems in addition to their work on the kinds of smart tools.</li>\n<li>I suggested that AI ought to focus on building what I called “habile” systems - ones that could learn to use smart tools, just as humans are able to learn to use them.</li>\n<li>More generally, it has always seemed to me that AI’s grand goal (the “prize” we are questing for) should be to develop artifacts that can do most of the things that humans can do - specifically those things that are thought to require “intelligence.”</li>\n<li>These systems would have what some AI researchers have called “Human Level Artificial Intelligence” (HLAI).</li>\n<li>HLAI was the goal of the founders and of many other early AI researchers. John McCarthy claims that the “first scientific discussion of human level machine intelligence was apparently by Alan Turing”.</li>\n<li>Turing made the mechanization of human-level intelligence an explicit goal in his 1950 “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” paper.</li>\n<li>Later, in the proposal for the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Study, John McCarthy wrote “The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.”</li>\n<li>In a 2003 paper, Edward Feigenbaum concluded “Computational Intelligence is the manifest destiny of computer science, the goal, the destination, the final frontier. More than any other field of science, our computer science concepts and methods are central to the quest to unravel and understand one of the grandest mysteries of our existence, the nature of intelligence. Generations of computer scientists to come must be inspired by the challenges and grand challenges of this great quest.”</li>\n<li>Let an ultraintelligent machine be dened as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an “intelligence explosion,” and the intelligence of man would be left far behind.</li>\n<li>Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.</li>\n<li>If artificial intelligences can be created at all, there is little reason to believe that initial successes could not lead swiftly to the construction of artificial superintelligences able to explore significant mathematical, scientific, or engineering alternatives at a rate far exceeding human ability, or to generate plans and take action on them with equally overwhelming speed.</li>\n<li>Since man’s near-monopoly of all higher forms of intelligence has been one of the most basic facts of human existence throughout the past history of this planet, such developments would clearly create a new economics, a new sociology, and a new history.</li>\n<li>To pass the test “programs must be able to perform the jobs ordinarily performed by humans. Progress toward human-level AI could then be measured by the fraction of these jobs that can be acceptably performed by machines.”</li>\n<li>I had in mind all kinds of jobs that humans get paid to perform - from skilled and unskilled labor to managerial and office work.</li>\n<li>Even though we already have AI systems that can do some things better than humans can do them, there are still many, many human cognitive skills that we don’t yet know how to automate.</li>\n<li>\n<p>I believe there are two reasons why AI researchers will continue to strive to automate these skills.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One is economic: The prospect of someday being able to employ AI systems rather than more expensive humans will sustain a strong and irresistible urge to build artifacts that can do what we now pay humans to do.</li>\n<li>The other reason is scientific: In their attempts to understand how the human brain works, people will continue to build computational models of its many functions. Thus, I think achieving some version of HLAI will continue to be AI’s long-term goal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>John McCarthy mentions two approaches toward achieving HLAI.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One is to attempt to simulate how the human intellect works, but, as he wrote, “Understanding the human brain well enough to imitate its function requires theoretical and experimental success in psychology and neurophysiology.”</li>\n<li>The other is to write programs that mimic human intelligent behavior, which is what AI researchers have largely been trying to do. McCarthy says that “It’sn’t a question of deciding between them, because each should eventually succeed; it’s more a race.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Minsky was right. We’ve been trying the alternatives of “advanced resources, given initially,” and simulating “organic evolution.” These approaches have produced smart tools and other useful programs but not HLAI yet. What about working on a “graded sequence of problems of growing difficulty”? This strategy has been suggested and deserves serious consideration.</li>\n<li>In his 1950 paper, Alan Turing suggested that “Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child’s? If this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain.” The “appropriate course of education” would then correspond to Minsky’s “graded sequence of problems.”</li>\n<li>“understanding the human brain well enough to imitate its function,” there has been work on that problem too. Several computer scientists are attempting to use concepts familiar to AI people to explain the brain.</li>\n<li>I have already mentioned the hierarchical models of the cortex proposed by Mumford, Hinton, Hawkins, Dean, and their various colleagues. Building on features of primitive sensory inputs from an array of pixels, for example, and ascending through ever-more-abstract percepts, these models are able to learn to classify images independently of size, translation, and orientation.</li>\n<li>Yet, to my knowledge, no work has yet been done to use these models for more than perception. Can they learn to understand, to reason, to plan, and to select actions?</li>\n<li>In 2007, Modha’s team carried out an historic experiment in which they constructed a computer simulation of a rat-scale model of the cortex (with 55 million spiking neurons and 448 billion synapses with spike-timing-dependent plasticity) that could function in near real-time using a BlueGene supercomputer with 32,768 processors and 8 TB of main memory.</li>\n<li>Modha is the principal investigator of a DARPA project to develop “Systems of Neuromorphic Adaptive Plastic Scalable Electronics” (SyNAPSE), or a project whose goal is to build a machine that mimics the actions of about 100 million neurons.</li>\n<li>That’s twice the number of neurons in a rat brain but only about 0.25% of the number in a human brain. One can hope that the top-down and bottom-up approaches will meet in the middle somewhere.</li>\n<li>Even setting this nightmare aside, one can fear a variety of more subtle deleterious impacts.</li>\n<li>E.g. Rapid collapse of human society into a self-destructive pure hedonism once all pressures, and perhaps even reasons or opportunities, for work and striving are undermined by the presence of unchallengeable omnicompetent mechanisms.</li>\n<li>Certainly man’s remaining sense of his own uniqueness may be further impaired, and he may come to seem in his own eyes little more than a primitive animal, capable only of fleeting enjoyments.</li>\n<li>Omohundro wants to make sure that we build “wisdom,” and not just intelligence, into our technologies.</li>\n<li>By that he means building in “human values, such as caring about human rights and property rights and having compassion for other entities.” He thinks it “absolutely critical that we build these in at the beginning, otherwise we’ll get systems that are powerful, but which don’t support our values.”</li>\n<li>Omohundro brings up valid concerns, but to put his version of wisdom into AI systems we’ll first have to agree on just what we mean by “human values.” That will be tough given that our different opinions about values often lead to wars.</li>\n<li>In any case, we should continue to pursue many different approaches, guided by our best judgments. It’s like heuristic search for a goal that we’ll recognize when we achieve it.</li>\n<li>Several disciplines have contributed to AI’s successes.</li>\n<li>The early AI pioneers used many clues about how to proceed - clues from mathematics and logic, from neuroscience, from linguistics, from statistics and probability theory, from control engineering, from psychology, and from computer science.</li>\n<li>Indeed, the substantial progress made in the quest for AI to date is due to the use of ideas from all of those disciplines. No overarching theory of AI has yet emerged, nor is one likely to in my opinion.</li>\n<li>The quest will continue. What combinations of AI’s methods, buttressed by AI’s supporting disciplines, will be used in the intelligent systems of the future? No one really knows, so we’ll have to keep all of them active on AI’s “search frontier.”</li>\n<li>Some of the ones developed early in the quest (and now perhaps forgotten) might with better technology be useful.</li>\n<li>Researchers who want to pursue the quest should be familiar with the full variety of AI’s methods, its contributing disciplines, and its history.</li>\n</ul>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/CR4-DL/textbooks/the-quest-for-artificial-intelligence/#part-i-beginnings\">Part I: Beginnings</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a
