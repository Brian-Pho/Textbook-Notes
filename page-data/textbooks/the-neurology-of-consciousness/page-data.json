brings about the most common and most dramatic change in consciousness that normal people can experience.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sleep stages and cycles</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Wakefulness</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EEG is characterized by waves of low amplitude and high frequency.</li>\n<li>Sleep is categorized into non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and REM sleep.</li>\n<li>NREM is divided into three stages: N1, N2, and N3.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stage N1</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Falling asleep is a gradual phenomenon of progressive disconnection from the environment.</li>\n<li>Eye movement slows, muscle tone relaxes, and there may be occasional jerks followed by a sense of falling.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stage N2</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After a few minutes in N1, people progress to N2 sleep.</li>\n<li><em>Sleep spindles</em>: waxing and waning oscillations at around 12-15 Hz that last about 1 s and occur 5-10 times a minute.</li>\n<li>This stage qualifies as sleep because people are partially disconnected from the environment, meaning their arousal threshold is increased.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stage N3</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eye movements cease.</li>\n<li>Also known as deep sleep as the arousal threshold is higher than in stage N2.</li>\n<li>Process of awakening from this stage is drawn out and subjects often remain confused for some time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>REM</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Also called paradoxical sleep because the EEG activity during REM sleep is similar to the activated EEG of waking or stage N1.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Sleep cycle</em>: the succession of NREM sleep stages followed by an episode of REM sleep.</li>\n<li>Sleep cycles last around 90-110 mins in humans.</li>\n<li>There are a total of 4-5 sleep cycles per night.</li>\n<li>The proportion of time spent in each stage and the pattern of stages across the night is fairly consistent in normal adults.</li>\n<li>5% in N1, 50% in N2, 20-25% in N3, and 20-25% in REM.</li>\n<li>Sleep patterns change markedly across the lifespan.</li>\n<li>From early childhood into adulthood, total sleep time decreases and the REM-sleep proportion drops to adult levels.</li>\n<li>Wakefulness depends on the upper pons (pedunculopontine tegmental (PPT) and lateral dorsal tegmental (LDT)), midbrain (reticular activation system (RAS)), posterior hypothalamus, and basal forebrain.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto;

brain structures are involved in the initiation and maintenance of sleep</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anterior hypothalamus</li>\n<li>Basal forebrain</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These neurons tend to fire during sleep and stop firing during wakefulness.</li>\n<li>When they’re active, many of them release GABA to inhibit most waking-promoting areas.</li>\n<li>In turn, most wake-promoting areas inhibit several sleep-promoting neuronal groups during wakefulness.</li>\n<li>This reciprocal inhibition provides state stability as each state reinforces itself and inhibits the opponent state.</li>\n<li>REM sleep depends on pontine cholinergic cell groups (LDT and PPT) that are part of the wakefulness system and nearby cell groups in the medial pontine reticular formation and medulla.</li>\n<li>Lesions in these areas eliminate REM sleep without disrupting NREM sleep.</li>\n<li>Metabolic activity is mostly due to the energetic requirements of synaptic transmission.</li>\n<li>After waking up, it can take up to 20 mins for blood flow to be fully reestablished in brain areas, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</li>\n<li><em>Sleep inertia</em>: a post-awakening deficit in alertness and performance that can last for tens of minutes.</li>\n<li>It’s likely that the sluggish reactivation of brain areas is responsible for sleep inertia.</li>\n<li>The most striking behavioral consequence of falling asleep is a progressive disconnection from the environment.</li>\n<li>This is due to the hyperpolarization of thalamocortical neurons so that sensory stimuli that normally would be relayed to the cortex fails to do so.</li>\n<li>In contrast to coma or vegetative state, a sleeping person can always be awakened if the stimuli are strong enough or meaningful.</li>\n<li>E.g. The sound of one’s name or the wailing of a baby are among the most effective signals for awakening.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two lessons from the consciousness in sleep</p>\n<ul>\n<li>During certain phases of sleep, the level of consciousness can decrease and vanish, despite stable activity in the thalamocortical system.</li>\n<li>During other phases of sleep, vivid conscious experience is possible, despite sensory and motor disconnections from the environment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Interestingly, if subjects were awakened during REM sleep, 80% of subjects report having dreams.</li>\n<li>Awakening from NREM sleep yield dreams 20% or less of the time.</li>\n<li>It’s now clear that reports indicative of conscious experience, including dream-like experiences, can be elicited during any stage of sleep.</li>\n<li>E.g. By changing the question from “Did you have a dream?” to “Tell me anything that was going through your mind just before you woke up”, the percentage of recalls from NREM sleep reaches 60%.</li>\n<li><em>Dreams</em>: consciousness in the absence of sensory inputs and self-reflection.</li>\n<li>All sensory experiences in dreams are generated internally; they’re hallucinations.</li>\n<li>During dreaming, there’s reduced voluntary controls and lack of reflective thought.</li>\n<li>When dreaming, one can’t stop and reflect rationally on what one should be doing, nor imagine other scenarios.</li>\n<li>This is consistent with neuroimaging findings that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is deactivated during REM sleep.</li>\n<li>Memory is drastically impaired both within the dream and for memorizing the dream.</li>\n<li>It isn’t clear why the dreaming brain is so profoundly amnestic aka why dreams are so easily forgotten.</li>\n<li>Analysis of patients with brain lesions indicates that the ability to dream depends on specific forebrain regions rather than on the brainstem REM sleep generator.</li>\n<li>E.g. Damage to the parieto-temporo-occipital junction, which is important for mental imagery and spatial cognition, prevents dreaming.</li>\n<li>The ability to dream seems to go hand-in-hand with the ability to imagine and with visuospatial skills.</li>\n<li>Many patients with brainstem lesions are able to dream.</li>\n<li>\n<p>When do children start dreaming and what kind of dreams do they have?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Children under the age of 7 rarely have dreams and the dreams they do have are often static and plain.</li>\n<li>Around age 7, dream reports become longer and more frequent, and the child’s self becomes a participant in the dream.</li>\n<li>Dream recall frequency was best correlated with the ability to produce waking mental images, and not with language ability.</li>\n<li>Blind adults have visual imagination and dream only if they lose their sight after age 7.</li>\n<li>Data suggests that dreaming is a gradual cognitive development that is tightly linked to the development of visual imagination.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Dissociated states</em>: states that lie between waking and sleep; the place between asleep and awake.</li>\n<li><em>Daydreaming</em>: a dream-like musing or fantasy while awake, especially for the fulfillment of wishes or hopes.</li>\n<li>Daydreaming is extremely common.</li>\n<li><em>Lucid dreaming</em>: dreaming with conscious control.</li>\n<li>Evidence suggests that brain areas that are relatively deactivated during REM sleep, such as the primary visual areas, the precuneus, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, become activated during lucid dreaming.</li>\n<li>Lucid dreaming may represent a dissociation between wakefulness and REM sleep.</li>\n<li><em>Sleepwalking (SW)</em>: various complex motor behaviors, such as walking, during deep NREM sleep.</li>\n<li>Sleepwalking appears as a dissociated state where some brain areas are awake while others are asleep.</li>\n<li>Sleep talking occurs more frequently than sleepwalking, and it can occur in both NREM and REM sleep.</li>\n<li><em>REM sleep behavior disorder</em>: vigorous, often violent, episodes of dream enactment with punching, kicking, and leaping.</li>\n<li>Researchers observed that if certain regions of the pons that are normally responsible for inhibiting muscle tone and motor programs are lesioned, cats seem to enact their dreams.</li>\n<li><em>Narcolepsy</em>: daytime sleepiness (sleep attacks).</li>\n<li>When narcoleptics fall asleep, they usually go straight into REM sleep, skipping all stages of NREM.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-8-sleepwalking-dissociation-between-body-sleep-and-mind-sleep\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-8-sleepwalking-dissociation-between-body-sleep-and-mind-sleep\" aria-label=\"chapter 8 sleepwalking dissociation between body sleep and mind sleep permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 8: Sleepwalking: Dissociation Between “Body Sleep” and “Mind Sleep”</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The frequency of SW is age-dependent.</li>\n<li>The peak frequency, about 10-15%, is seen in children around the ages of 8-12 years old.</li>\n<li>SW is rare in adults, occurring in 2-4%.</li>\n<li>During SW, the eyes are open and staring and the person is difficult to awaken.</li>\n<li>SW arises from genetic, developmental, somatic, and psychological factors.</li>\n<li>The fundamental cause of state dissociation in SW remains unknown.</li>\n<li>Skipped this chapter due to disinterest in sleepwalking.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-9-consciousness-and-anesthesia\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-9-consciousness-and-anesthesia\" aria-label=\"chapter 9 consciousness and anesthesia permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 9: Consciousness and Anesthesia</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>General anesthetics is in a unique position to study consciousness because it always suppresses consciousness in a reversible manner.</li>\n<li>In about 1-2 of 1000 people, they’re able to remember surgical events under anesthesia.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

away.</li>\n<li>Recent work suggests that epilepsy, like other DOC, disrupts a core network of anatomical structures critical for the maintenance of normal consciousness, referred to as the consciousness system.</li>\n<li>Since epileptic seizures causes deficits in consciousness, the study of seizures provides an opportunity to functionally localize specific aspects of consciousness in the brain.</li>\n<li>Epileptic seizures are usually classified as either focal, generalized, or absence.</li>\n<li>Interestingly, impaired consciousness can be seen in all three types.</li>\n<li>The consciousness system is directly involved in controlling the level of consciousness, including alertness, attention, and awareness.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The consciousness system includes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Frontal and parietal association cortex</li>\n<li>Cingulate gyrus</li>\n<li>Precuneus</li>\n<li>Thalamus</li>\n<li>Multiple activating systems in the basal forebrain, hypothalamus, midbrain, and upper pons</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Recent studies show that all three types of seizures cause abnormal increases in activity in the upper brainstem and medial thalamus.</li>\n<li>In absence seizures, awareness briefly vanishes and patients appear as if someone has pushed the “pause button” on their stream of consciousness.</li>\n<li>In focal seizures, impaired consciousness can persist for up to several minutes after the seizure has ended.</li>\n<li><em>Network inhibition hypothesis</em>: impaired consciousness occurs due to spread of temporal lobe seizures to midline subcortical structures.</li>\n<li>E.g. Regions rich in GABAergic neurons such as the lateral septal nuclei and anterior hypothalamus may inhibit subcortical arousal structures, causing bilateral cortical suppression and impaired consciousness.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

Consciousness</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Review of patient H.M.</li>\n<li>The hallmark of anterograde amnesia is the inability to learn new information, despite relatively intact abilities to retrieve premorbid memories.</li>\n<li>Interestingly, one patient with impaired memory displayed a normal full-scale IQ.</li>\n<li>An important distinction is between long-term memory (LTM) and short-term memory (STM).</li>\n<li>LTE is memory for information that hasn’t been in conscious awareness for the last several tens of seconds, whereas STM refers to the temporary retention of a limited amount of information.</li>\n<li>We might infer that many aspects of consciousness are largely unaffected by anterograde amnesia.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Patients with anterograde amnesia typically have damage

as one of storage or retrieval.</li>\n<li>There’s a separation between retrieval with subjective experience (autonoetic) and retrieval without subjective experience (noetic).</li>\n<li>There have been no cases of anterograde amnesia followed by the absence of any retrograde memory impairment.</li>\n<li>Instead, irreversible damage to the MTL invariably produces some retrograde memory loss.</li>\n<li>The concept of consolidation captures the idea that the MTL must continue to play a role in memory processing after the initial encoding of information.</li>\n<li>Is the retrieval process for recollection and familiarity a single process or separate processes?</li>\n<li>This question is currently being debated by the neuroscience community but evidence suggests that the two processes are separate.</li>\n<li>For anterograde amnesia patients, each waking moment feels as though they just woke up from sleep.</li>\n<li>There’s a fundamental role for the hippocampus in determining the width of the stream of consciousness.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Posterior hippocampus.</li>\n<li>In general, no studies reported direct evidence for the establishment of new pathways but only volume increases in existing cortico-cortical pathways.</li>\n<li>Since no additional tracts have been found in early blind subjects, the data suggest that cross-modal functionality of the visual cortex in early blindness is primarily due to preserved or strengthened cortico-cortical connections, and not due to new connections.</li>\n<li>In blind people, the visual cortex doesn’t just handle more tactile processing, it’s also been shown to handle language processing, verbal memory, sound discrimination, and selective attention.</li>\n<li>Why does the brain do this? Does this reflect some kind of Darwinian principle for survival?</li>\n<li>Since we know that around 30% of the brain’s cortical surface is devoted to visual processing, the loss of vision is one of the most incapacitating events that can happen to a person.</li>\n<li>To survive, blind people have to rely on their other senses and they develop these in a superhuman manner.</li>\n<li>E.g. Blind people have superior tactile and auditory discrimination and superior verbal memory functions to compensate for their loss of vision.</li>\n<li>This is also evidence for AI, that we can have superhuman abilities if we had more brain area for each sense.</li>\n<li>Further evidence for this comes from imaging studies showing that enhanced practice leads to an enlargement of cortical representations.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Consciousness is the experience, not the stuff before and after.</li>\n<li>E.g. Expectations, task planning, self-monitoring, unconscious stimulus processing, or verbal reporting.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consciousness and sensory input/motor output</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are usually conscious of what goes on around us and what goes on within our body.</li>\n<li>So it’s natural to think that consciousness may be tightly linked to the ongoing interactions between the world and body.</li>\n<li>However, there are many examples that contest this idea.</li>\n<li>E.g. Stimulus-independent consciousness. We are conscious of our thoughts, which don’t seem to correspond to anything out there, we can also imagine things that aren’t real, we also dream.</li>\n<li>When we do, sensory areas can be activated from the inside.</li>\n<li>All that seems to matter is that the corticothalamic system continues to function during dreaming and wakefulness.</li>\n<li>Further evidence that neither sensory inputs nor motor outputs are needed to generate consciousness comes from blind people and from locked-in syndrome patients.</li>\n<li>E.g. People with retina blindness can both imagine and dream visually if they become blind after the age of 6-7 years old. Locked-in syndrome patients can be almost completely paralyzed, and yet they’re just as conscious as healthy subjects.</li>\n<li>Thus, consciousness seems to depend on what certain parts of the brain are doing, without requiring any interaction with the environment or the body.</li>\n<li>This also refutes Antonio Damasio’s theory of consciousness that depends on the brain feeling itself and the body.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consciousness and language</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There have also been claims that consciousness only emerges with language.</li>\n<li>However, neurological evidence from patients with aphasia shows that it doesn’t interrupt the flow of experience, even though it may change or remove certain aspects of it like inner speech.</li>\n<li>Consciousness continues in the absence of language.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consciousness and introspection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consciousness is usually evaluated by verbal reports, which suggests that consciousness may arise through the ability to reflect on our own perceptions.</li>\n<li>So it’s natural to suggest that consciousness may arise through the ability to reflect on our own perceptions.</li>\n<li>Contradicting evidence comes from when we become absorbed in some intense perceptual task.</li>\n<li>E.g. Watching an engrossing movie, playing a fast-paced video game, in a major accident, or during non-lucid dreaming.</li>\n<li>We are vividly conscious, as in we’re immersed in the rapid flow of experience, but without the need for reflection or introspection.</li>\n<li>Often, we become so immersed that we may lose our sense of self, our inner voice.</li>\n<li>Much of experience is unreflective but that doesn’t mean that we’re not conscious of it.</li>\n<li>Another study of a classification task that varied the speed of the experiment found that the slow and fast conditions were similar in the cognitive task but differed in the sensorimotor and attentional loads.</li>\n<li>Behavioral measurements confirmed that self-awareness was high during the slow condition but abolished during the fast condition.</li>\n<li>The results of the study showed that during the slow, introspective condition, there was activation of prefrontal regions, whereas during the fast condition, there was strong activation of the sensory cortex.</li>\n<li>Crucially, during the fast condition, self-related cortex was deactivated below the rest condition.</li>\n<li>This deactivation of prefrontal regions was thus the neural correlated of “losing oneself” during the fast condition.</li>\n<li>These prefrontal regions are involved in self-representations and suggest that their activation isn’t necessary for perceptual consciousness, but only to reflect upon it and to report it to others.</li>\n<li>It appears that self-related activity is actually shut off during highly demanding sensory tasks.</li>\n<li>Frontal activity relates to introspection and reporting rather than to conscious perception.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consciousness and attention</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attention and consciousness often go hand-in-hand.</li>\n<li>E.g. When we pay attention to an object, it becomes more vivid. And when we shift it away, it fades from consciousness.</li>\n<li>While attention and consciousness may seem to be identical, there are strong arguments for the dissociation between attention and consciousness.</li>\n<li>E.g. Paying attention to a stimulus decreases the duration of its afterimage, whereas consciously seeing the stimulus increases the duration of its afterimage.</li>\n<li>Attention can also be deployed to a stimulus that remains unconscious.</li>\n<li>The other dissociation, consciousness without attention, is more controversial.</li>\n<li>E.g. When driving along a familiar road, we might not be paying attention to the road but does that mean we don’t experience it at all.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consciousness and memory</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There’s also a dissociation between working memory and consciousness as there are patients with prefrontal lesions, where working memory is severely compromised, but consciousness is clearly preserved.</li>\n<li>There’s also the case of people with amnesia that have lost their episodic memories but are still conscious.</li>\n<li>E.g. Patient H.M.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consciousness and space</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The brain employs different maps of space using different frames of reference.</li>\n<li>E.g. Eye-centered. head-centered, and body-centered maps.</li>\n<li>Like attention, it’s difficult to dissociate consciousness from spatial awareness.</li>\n<li>E.g. The condition of neglect pairs awareness and consciousness to ignore a part of the visual field, body, or space.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consciousness and the bodily self</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can consciousness exist in the absence of a sense of self or of a body?</li>\n<li>\n<p>Distinctions of self</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Narrative, autobiographical self</em>: the self that characterizes the fundamental sense of who we are.</li>\n<li><em>Feeling of agency</em>: experiencing that one is the source of one’s actions.</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Feeling of ownership</em>: the knowledge that your body and its parts are yours.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. The body is heavily represented in the brain.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Experiments like the rubber hand illusion show us that our sense of ownership can be altered.</li>\n<li>Conditions like asomatognosia further show us that our sense of ownership over our own body can be altered without changes in consciousness.</li>\n<li>Even if we take away the bodily self, our experience still seems to be centered somewhere behind the eyes.</li>\n<li>Consciousness feels to be centered somewhere.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>To locate the brain regions for each conscious modality, we would look to regions whose lesions eliminates the experience of colors, shapes, faces, etc.</li>\n<li>However, creating such a list is difficult because lesions are rarely selective and symptoms change with time.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three criteria for mapping a brain region to sensory experience</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The complete loss of the corresponding sensory experiences.</li>\n<li>The complete loss of the ability to imagine, remember, or dream any such experience.</li>\n<li>The complete loss of the first-hand understanding of what’s missing.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>To explain why we need these three criteria, we do a simple thought experiment.</li>\n<li>The experiment supposes that we have a hypothetical sixth sense, say echolocation.</li>\n<li>We aren’t endowed with the the neural hardware for generating echolocation experiences and when we move around, we don’t experience any echolocation-like experiences.</li>\n<li>It isn’t just a matter of not having the appropriate sensors or sensory pathways, we can’t even imagine what such an experience would feel like, or dream that we are echolocating.</li>\n<li>We also don’t understand first-hand what we’re missing even though we know how it works in principle in bats.</li>\n<li>So given that we don’t, can’t, and don’t dream of echolocation experiences, we conclude that the brain has no region for echolocation.</li>\n<li>A more concrete examples comes from our ability to see color.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Suppose we have three regions to handle color processing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Area A provides processed sensory input to area C.</li>\n<li>Area B can generate similar patterns in C in a top-down manner, implementing the ability to imagine colors.</li>\n<li>Area C providing us with color experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There are patients where damage to each area leads to a different experience of color.</li>\n<li>E.g. There are patients that can imagine, remember, and dream of colors but can’t recognize colors (damaged area A).</li>\n<li>E.g. There are patients that can’t imagine colors but can perceive and understand what color means (damaged area B).</li>\n<li>E.g. There are patients that can’t imagine or perceive color but still understand it (damaged areas A and B).</li>\n<li>However, the feeling of an absence isn’t the same as the absence of feeling.</li>\n<li>E.g. Having a functional but inactive area C is very different from not having it at all.</li>\n<li>E.g. There are patients, and other species, that aren’t conscious of color (damaged area C).</li>\n<li>While the patient wouldn’t understand first-hand what color means and what they’re missing, they could talk about it second-hand, just as we can talk about echolocation.</li>\n<li><em>Absolute agnosia</em>: lack of first-hand understanding and experience of a sense.</li>\n<li>Do other examples of anosognosia (unawareness of deficit) represent a similar lack of first-hand understanding for that modality?</li>\n<li>Patients with anosognosia often seem to deny their loss without understanding what they’re talking about.</li>\n<li>E.g. Patients with Anton’s syndrome can be completely blind due to cortical lesions but still insist that they do see.</li>\n<li>E.g. Patients with anosognosia for motor deficits may result from lesions of the right premotor cortex and right insula.</li>\n<li>These lesions would compromise the comparison between signals representing the intended actions (efference copy) and those monitoring the actual action (feedback).</li>\n<li>In this way, the area responsible for motor awareness (area C) would receive the motor intention signals, but no mismatch signal, and wouldn’t be able to tell that the movement wasn’t executed.</li>\n<li>Another explanation is that the input layer for motor awareness can’t tell if the activity it receives is due to intrinsic or extrinsic sources.</li>\n<li>Neurology distinguishes between levels of consciousness and contents of consciousness.</li>\n<li>E.g. Levels of consciousness are sleep, wakefulness, coma.</li>\n<li>E.g. Contents of consciousness are the experiences you are having at the moment.</li>\n<li>On one side, there are localized brain lesions that affect the contents of consciousness, such as agnosia, without affecting the level of consciousness.</li>\n<li>On the other side, there are lesions that affect the level of consciousness, such as coma, that don’t affect the contents of consciousness.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sleep</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Review of waking up from NREM and REM sleep.</li>\n<li>During NREM sleep, if TMS is applied, it remains localized to the site of stimulation without spreading out and activating connected brain regions.</li>\n<li>There’s a correlation between the reduced level of consciousness during sleep and the break down of connectivity among cortical regions.</li>\n<li>Measurements suggest that the sleeping brain becomes bistable. It either breaks down in causally independent modules or bursts into a global, stereotypical response.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/e9fb54de719ef8a3520d6796bdb61afc/c8ad9/figure25-3.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.400000000000006%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 25.3\"\n        title=\"Figure 25.3\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/e9fb54de719ef8a3520d6796bdb61afc/00d43/figure25-3.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/e9fb54de719ef8a3520d6796bdb61afc/63868/figure25-3.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/e9fb54de719ef8a3520d6796bdb61afc/0b533/figure25-3.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/e9fb54de719ef8a3520d6796bdb61afc/00d43/figure25-3.png 1000w,\n/CR4-DL/static/e9fb54de719ef8a3520d6796bdb61afc/aa440/figure25-3.png 1500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/e9fb54de719ef8a3520d6796bdb61afc/c8ad9/figure25-3.png 1564w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n<li>Lucid dreaming is a good example of the dissociation between consciousness and reflective consciousness.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Anesthesia</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After sleeping, anesthesia is the next most common manipulation of the level of consciousness.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Anesthesia comes in two class</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Intravenous</em>: injected into the blood stream.</li>\n<li><em>Inhaled</em>: breathed in.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>At low levels of inhaled anesthesia, subjects report distortions of time perception, a feeling of disconnection from the environment, and drowsiness.</li>\n<li>At medium levels, people experience a shrinking in the field of consciousness, as if they were on the verge of falling asleep.</li>\n<li>The transition to unconsciousness (loss of consciousness (LOC)) is sudden, suggesting that neural processes underlying consciousness change in a non-linear manner.</li>\n<li>At the cellular level, many anesthetics have mixed effects, but the overall result is a decrease in neuronal excitability by either increasing inhibition or decreasing excitation.</li>\n<li>E.g. Enhancing GABA inhibition or hyperpolarizing cells by leaking potassium.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Several anesthetics act on common sites such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Posterior cingulate cortex</li>\n<li>Parietal cortex</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It’s difficult to say, however, if anesthetics produce unconsciousness when they affect a particular set of areas, or if they produce widespread deactivation of corticothalamic circuits.</li>\n<li>The most consistent effect is a reduction of thalamic metabolism and blood flow, suggesting that the thalamus may serve as a consciousness switch.</li>\n<li>Remember that fMRI signals mostly reflect synaptic activity rather than cellular firing.</li>\n<li>Another study showed that when a patient lost consciousness, the cortical EEG changed dramatically but thalamic EEG didn’t change until 10 minutes later.</li>\n<li>This implies that the deactivation of cortex alone is sufficient for loss of consciousness and doesn’t require thalamic activity.</li>\n<li>Anesthetics may also induce LOC by disrupting the integration between the corticothalamic system as this system seems to be organized like a small-world network.</li>\n<li>Thus, anesthetics only need to disrupt a few long-range connections to disrupt integration and global connectivity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Coma and related states</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coma and vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) are characterized by a loss of consciousness that is hard or impossible to reverse.</li>\n<li>Recovery from a vegetative state is associated with restoring the functional connectivity between intralaminar thalamic nuclei and prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Seizures</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LOC during the tonic phase of generalized seizures is noteworthy because it occurs at times when neuronal activity is extremely high and synchronous.</li>\n<li>\n<p>All seizures that cause an impairment of consciousness are associated with changes in activity in three sets of brain areas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased activity in the upper brainstem and medial thalamus.</li>\n<li>Decreased activity in the anterior and posterior cingulate, medial frontal cortex, and precuneus.</li>\n<li>Altered activity in the lateral and orbital frontal cortex and in the lateral parietal cortex.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It isn’t known which of these three sets of areas are crucial for the LOC.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two things are clear</p>\n<ul>\n<li>These same areas are also affected in sleep, anesthesia, and vegetative state.</li>\n<li>It seems that consciousness is lost when neurons are excessively and synchronously active, rather than inactive.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Despite knowing this, it’s difficult to converge on a set of brain structures that are sufficient and necessary for consciousness.</li>\n<li>What’s undisputed is that broad lesions or inactivation of the corticothalamic system abolish consciousness.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Evidence for this fact</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unambiguous examples of unresponsive wakefulness syndrome demonstrate that the loss of consciousness is usually associated with widespeard lesions of the grey or white matter of the cortex, and most of the time with significant thalamic involvement.</li>\n<li>Lesions outside of the corticothalamic system don’t affect consciousness.</li>\n<li>E.g. Spinal cord and cerebellum.</li>\n<li>Rather than playing a direct role in consciousness, the cerebellum appears to function to control the acquisition of sensory inputs and as a learning device for motor, perceptual, and cognitive functions.</li>\n<li>Lesions involving parts of the basal ganglia and the anterior cingulate can result in akinetic mutism.</li>\n<li>Bilateral hippocampal lesions that abolish episodic, autobiographical memory don’t abolish consciousness. What consciousness remains is less rich as there’s a deficit in imagination and duration of the conscious present.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Brainstem structures offer an instructive example of the difference between the neural substrate of consciousness and the facts that enable it.</li>\n<li>Patients who awaken from a vegetative state show us that a functioning brainstem is insufficient for consciousness in the absence of a functioning corticothalamic system.</li>\n<li>E.g. There’s wakefulness but no experience.</li>\n<li>The reticular activating system appears to have the role of an enabler/controller of the level of consciousness, rather than as a generator of consciousness.</li>\n<li>Does the primary visual cortex contribute directly to visual consciousness, or only indirectly?</li>\n<li>E.g. Consider retinal neurons. Even though they contribute to our visual experience, they don’t contribute directly to conscious experience. Examples include losing retinal neurons and still having conscious visual experiences, the rapidly shifting firing patterns don’t match our more stable perception, blinks and eye movements don’t dramatically change perception, and the blind spot isn’t aware by consciousness.</li>\n<li>For V1, activity tends to follow the physical stimulus rather than the percept, unlike neurons higher up in the visual hierarchy.</li>\n<li>Lesions of V1 lead to the phenomenon of blindsight where patients claim to have no conscious visual perception but they perform better than chance on tasks.</li>\n<li>Evidence supports the idea that blindsight is due to subcortical visual pathways that originate from the superior colliculus and bypass the primary visual cortex.</li>\n<li>High intensity TMS or direct electrical stimulation, regardless of the brain area, usually fails to affect consciousness, with a few exceptions.</li>\n<li>Current evidence supports the hypothesis that V1 doesn’t contribute directly to visual experience, and this may generalize to other primary areas.</li>\n<li>Lesion studies support the idea that consciousness don’t require the prefrontal cortex and thus, doesn’t require the functions it performs.</li>\n<li>E.g. Early studies showed that large, bilateral prefrontal resections didn’t abolish consciousness, such as in a lobotomy.</li>\n<li>Damage to the medial prefrontal cortex, however, leads to patients with akinetic mutism.</li>\n<li>It’s controversial if akinetic mutism implies consciousness with a lack of motivation or if they’re unconsciousness.</li>\n<li>In the rare case that a person recovers from akinetic mutism, the person usually has amnesia for the akinetic episode.</li>\n<li>Being self-conscious (reflecting upon what one perceives) is different from being conscious (perceiving it), yet both are experiences.</li>\n<li>Activation of the attention network has been correlated with subjects’ reports of being strongly aware of their external environment, while activation of the default system has been correlated with reports of being strongly aware of their internal environment.</li>\n<li>In some tests, the right hemisphere’s cognitive style is strangely “un-human”.</li>\n<li>E.g. In a guessing game where a stimulus is red 75% of the time and green 25% of the time, the left hemisphere matches the probability distribution by guessing red 75% of the time and green 25% of the time. The right hemisphere, however, guesses red 100% of the time, therefore matching the way rats and goldfish guess.</li>\n<li>It’s assumed that a sequence of feed-forward processing steps seems far too straightforward and simple to offer a substrate for subjective experience.</li>\n<li>The sheer abundance of back-connections in sensory regions suggests that they should serve some important purpose in giving rise to a conscious percept.</li>\n<li>However, there are numerous back-connections within the dorsal visual stream but it doesn’t contribute to conscious experience.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Possible roles for backward connections</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mediate receptive field neurons.</li>\n<li>Provide a substrate for both attentional modulation and imagery.</li>\n<li>Dynamically route signals according to prior expectations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>But are backward connections critical for consciousness?</li>\n<li>One experiment suggests that they are critical for consciousness.</li>\n<li>E.g. Flashing a image very quickly is sufficient for automatic categorization but seems insufficient to generate a conscious percept.</li>\n<li>Another set of experiments provides evidence that visual stimuli only become conscious when the feed-forward sweep is joined by a feed-back sweep.</li>\n<li>As the studies above show, changes in neural activity don’t necessarily correlate with changes in conscious experience.</li>\n<li>Perhaps some additional, dynamic feature of neural activity must be present to generate consciousness.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Features such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Synchronous or oscillatory activity</li>\n<li>The P3b wave and other evoked potentials</li>\n<li>Cortical activation</li>\n<li>Sustained vs phasic activity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reasons to look at synchronous activity</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Synchronized groups of neurons can bind together features of a stimulus by being active at the same time.</li>\n<li>Groups of synchronized neurons could encode separate stimuli by precise phase locking.</li>\n<li>Synchronous activity is represented at the neuronal level by Hebb’s rule and STDP.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>However, there may be consciousness without synchrony.</li>\n<li>E.g. Experiences that don’t require much binding such as an experience of pure darkness or of pure blue. It would seem to only require the strong activation of the relevant neurons, with no need for signaling relatedness.</li>\n<li>The P300 wave, or P3b component, isn’t a reliable indicator of consciousness.</li>\n<li><em>P300 wave</em>: a late positive event-related potential (ERP) appearing after 300 ms or more after an event.</li>\n<li>There’s evidence that P3b doesn’t show up even though subjects are conscious of the stimuli.</li>\n<li>Also, one can’t rely on the P3b signal to distinguish between consciousness and unconsciousness.</li>\n<li>The experience of “now” unfolds at a time resolution/scale between tens and several hundred milliseconds.</li>\n<li><em>Attentional blink</em>: when the detection of a target in a rapid stream impairs the detection of subsequent targets.</li>\n<li>If micro-saccades are counteracted by image stabilization on the retina, then stationary objects fade and become completely invisible.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integrated information theory of consciousness (ITT)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Believes that an essential property of consciousness is that it exists intrinsically.</li>\n<li>The information associated with the occurrence of a conscious state is integrated information.</li>\n<li>When you have a particular experience, that experience is an integrated whole as you don’t experience each component separately.</li>\n<li>E.g.
