We might recognize at some point that we’re scared but the feeling of being scared didn’t start when we noticed it. It started before we became aware of it.</li>\n<li>It’s the same distinction between knowing that a person is feeling something without actually feeling it.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three stages of processing</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>State of emotion</em>: triggered and executed nonconsciously.</li>\n<li><em>State of feeling</em>: represented nonconsciously.</li>\n<li><em>State of feeling made conscious</em>: known to the organism having both emotion and feeling.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Homeostasis</em>: the coordinated and mostly automated physiological reactions by the body to maintain a steady internal state in living organisms.</li>\n<li>View emotions as an embodiment of the logic of survival due to how they shape our risk assessment and decision making.</li>\n<li>The brain knows more than the conscious mind reveals.</li>\n<li>E.g. Cases of hemispatial neglect.</li>\n<li>Emotions can be induced in a nonconscious manner and thus appear to the conscious self as coming from an unknown cause.</li>\n<li>Because emotions come from the nonconscious, it is difficult to control emotions.</li>\n<li>One partial exception to nonconscious control is breathing because autonomic respiration and voluntary vocalization both use the lungs.</li>\n<li><em>Background emotion</em>: nontraditional emotions that display themselves through subtle body positions, speed of movement, and movement of eyes.</li>\n<li>Evidence suggests that emotional responses are a result of a long history of evolutionary fine-tuning.</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are two biological functions of emotion</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The production of a specific reaction to a situation.</li>\n<li>The regulation of the internal state of the organism so that it can be prepared for the specific reaction.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>E.g.

Fear activates the amygdala.</li>\n<li>The release of substances from a small part of the brain can alter the mode of processing of many other brain circuits.</li>\n<li>We don’t learn to wince from pain, we just wince.</li>\n<li>Pain and emotion aren’t the same because pain is a sensory feeling and because different interventions interfere with one but not the other.</li>\n<li>Pain and pleasure can cause emotional reactions but are not emotions themselves.</li>\n<li>Both sensations form a duality, one that punishes and one that rewards.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-3-core-consciousness\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-3-core-consciousness\" aria-label=\"chapter 3 core consciousness permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 3: Core Consciousness</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>All the contents in our mind are subjective and the power of science comes from its ability to verify objectively the consistency of many individual subjectivities.</li>\n<li>The study of consciousness proceeds under the assumption that the processes of the mind, such as consciousness, is grounded in brain activity.</li>\n<li>There are consistent and predictable external manifestations of consciousness that are identifiable and measurable.</li>\n<li>E.g. Being awake, attentive to stimuli, behavior.</li>\n<li>An organisms behavior is like an orchestra with my different instruments and groups producing different melodies.</li>\n<li>However, some instruments and groups only play at certain times and are absent in others.</li>\n<li>Some components are always present.</li>\n<li>E.g. Wakefulness, background emotion, low level attention.</li>\n<li>But these components always play in symphony and rarely conflict.</li>\n<li>However, there’s one component that has no external counterpart and that is consciousness.</li>\n<li>Consciousness can only be inferred to exist because of its influence on external behaviors.</li>\n<li>Wakefulness and consciousness tend to go together except in cases of dream sleep and being awake but not conscious.</li>\n<li>Attention only betrays the presence of normal consciousness when it can be sustained over a substantial period of time.</li>\n<li>E.g. Over minutes or hours rather than seconds.</li>\n<li>Sustained purposefulness such as planning also betrays the presence of consciousness but lack of planning doesn’t.</li>\n<li>Normal human behavior exhibits a continuity of emotions induced by the continuity of thoughts.</li>\n<li>E.g. The emotional tone when you speak.</li>\n<li>The continuity of normal consciousness requires a brief memory, on the order of a fraction of a second.</li>\n<li>We are students of consciousness.</li>\n<li>There’s a condition known as epileptic automatism where a patient has suspended consciousness for a brief period and also loses the ability to remember what happened during that period.</li>\n<li>However, the person is awake as their eyes are open and muscle tone is maintained but they are devoid of deliberate actions.</li>\n<li>Emotion is also suspended when consciousness disappears.</li>\n<li>We hypothesize that the absence of emotion is a reliable correlate of defective CC.</li>\n<li>Maybe this is related to psychopaths and how they’re often described as “without conscious”.</li>\n<li>Emotion and CC tend to go together.</li>\n<li>What about being drunk?</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alzheimer’s disease is often described without mentioning this symptom.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>That the decline first affects EC by narrowing its scope progressively until all semblance of autobiographical self disappears.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Neurological diseases act like a scalpel by separating mental functions.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Facts we’ve learnt from Alzheimer’s</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There’s a separation between wakefulness, low-level attention and behaviors with emotions.</li>\n<li>The defect of knowing and self goes hand in hand with defects in planning, high-level attention, and sustained behaviors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Classification of disruptions in CC</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disrupted CC with preserved wakefulness and preserved minimal attention/behavior.</li>\n<li>E.g.

A stroke victim being entirely paralyzed on their left side and not knowing.</li>\n<li>Anosognosia occurs only with right hemisphere damage at a very specific region.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The specific regions are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Right hemisphere</li>\n<li>Cortices in the insula</li>\n<li>Cytoarchitectonic areas 3, 1, 2</li>\n<li>Area S2</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Anosognosia results from an inability to represent current body states automatically and through the appropriate signaling channels.</li>\n<li>However, this doesn’t explain why patients deny their condition when told so and when they can see it themselves.</li>\n<li>The hypothesis is that the damage removes the highest level of integrated representation of the organism which means the protoself no longer has access to it.</li>\n<li>This explains why patients are unaware of their impairment; its because they don’t have the hardware anymore to even let the protoself know that it has a left side that it can control.</li>\n<li><em>Asomatognosia</em>: a condition where the patient lacks recognition of their body.</li>\n<li>This occurred in a patient demonstrating how, in contrast to anosognosia, the patient still retained the idea that the body belonged to the self but that the body wasn’t responding.</li>\n<li>There are plenty of brain regions that aren’t concerned with making CC.</li>\n<li>The notion of two keeps appearing in the study of brains and minds.

The existence of multiple identities within us that get shut down is evidenced by the people where it doesn’t shut down.</li>\n<li>People with multiple personalities are evidence when the brain mechanisms that shut down other identities is broken.</li>\n<li>We aren’t conscious of which memories we store, how we classify them, and how to control the strength of memories.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Out of

as when we process an object.</li>\n<li>It’s more difficult to imagine though because instead of an external object to represent, we are representing the neural activity pattern in emotion induction sites.</li>\n<li>E.g of emotion induction sites include the hypothalamus, brain stem, basal forebrain, amygdala, and ventromedial prefrontal cortices.</li>\n<li>E.g. of second-order structures include the thalamus and cingulate cortices.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The steps of feeling a feeling</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Engagement of the organism by an induce of emotion.</li>\n<li>Signals from processing the object activate neural sites that respond, the emotion-induction sites.</li>\n<li>The emotion-induction sites trigger a cascade of responses from other brain sites that constitute emotion.</li>\n<li>First-order neural maps represent the changes in body state, regardless of if they were achieved by “body loop” or “internal stimulation”. Feelings emerge.</li>\n<li>The pattern of neural activity at the emotion-induction sites are mapped to second order structures and so are the changes to the protoself.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Arguments</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Emotion precedes feeling.</li>\n<li>Having a feeling isn’t the same as knowing a feeling.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Maybe consciousness started as an organism needed to know how it felt but then got extended to all sensory events.</li>\n<li>Maybe knowing that it feels was an evolutionary advantage.</li>\n<li>As if versus as is.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-10-using-consciousness\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-10-using-consciousness\" aria-label=\"chapter 10 using consciousness permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 10: Using Consciousness</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Why is consciousness beneficial?</li>\n<li>We start with how powerful unconscious processing is.</li>\n<li>Examples include slow and fasting thinking and the ability to learn.</li>\n<li>So given how the regulation of life can be achieved without conscious processing and that skill learning can be automated, why does consciousness exist?</li>\n<li>It exists for extending the minds reach and improving the life of the organism whose mind can reach farther.</li>\n<li>Consciousness is valuable because it introduces a new way of achieving homeostasis and because it centers knowledge on the life of an individual organism.</li>\n<li>As a consequence, will we eventually be able to gain access to each other’s mental experiences?</li>\n<li>The author believes no.</li>\n<li>Explaining how to make something mental is different from making that something mental.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;
