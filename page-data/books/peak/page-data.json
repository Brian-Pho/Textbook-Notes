Muscles grow larger.</li>\n<li>Mental challenges are different because you don’t see any changes in your brain.

Homeostasis.</li>\n<li>When a body system is stressed to the point that homeostasis can no longer be maintained, the body responds with changes that are intended to reestablish homeostasis.</li>\n<li>In the brain, the greater the challenge, the greater the change, up to a point.</li>\n<li>The brain, like the body, changes most quickly in that sweet spot where it’s pushed outside, but not too far outside, it’s comfort zone.</li>\n<li>Paper on how the brain changes: <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.468.880&#x26;rep=rep1&#x26;type=pdf\">Increased Cortical Representation of the Fingers of the Left Hand in String Players</a>.</li>\n<li>The most effective forms of practice are doing more than helping you learn to play a musical instrument; they’re actually increasing your ability to play.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Regular training leads to changes in the parts of the brain that are challenged by the training. The brain adapts to these challenges by rewiring itself in ways that increase its ability to carry out the functions required by the challenges. There are a few additional details.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One, younger brains are more adaptable. Small changes in the beginning lead to bigger changes later. Think chaos theory, butterfly effect, compound interest.</li>\n<li>Two, developing certain parts of the brain through prolonged training can come at a cost. In many cases, people who have developed one skill or ability to an extraordinary degree seem to have regressed in another area. Think tradeoff, finite brain size.</li>\n<li>Third, cognitive and physical changes caused by training require upkeep. Think don’t use it lose it, homeostasis acts against us in this case.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>People don’t possess these extraordinary capabilities isn’t because they don’t have the capacity for them, but rather its because they’re satisfied to live in the comfort of homeostasis and never do the work required to get out of it.

And, what sorts of training made it possible?</li>\n<li>The only two areas where we know for certain that genetics affects sports performance are height and body size.</li>\n<li>It’s natural to assume that those differences in learning rate persist, that the same people who did so well in the beginning will continue to breeze through later on.</li>\n<li>This is an understandable result of observing the beginning of the journey and concluding that the rest of the journey will be similar.

IQ between 110 and 120 for scientist.</li>\n<li>We do know that among those people who have practiced enough and have reached a certain level of skill in their chosen field, there is no evidence that any genetically determined abilities play a role in deciding who will be among the best.</li>\n<li>The strong argument against talent: if some sort of innate ability were playing a role in deciding who eventually becomes the best, it would be much easier to spot those future champions early in their careers.</li>\n<li>No one has ever managed to figure out how to identify people with innate talent.</li>\n<li>Maybe the genetic difference manifests itself as “hardworking” or “focus” genes.
