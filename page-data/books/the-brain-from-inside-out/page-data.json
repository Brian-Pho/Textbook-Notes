What initiates my finger movement?</li>\n<li>One reason why we don’t have answers to these questions is because the brain is complicated and our science of it is still in its young phase.</li>\n<li>Many of the unknowns, the true mysteries of the brain, are hidden in the middle; between the sensory receptors and motor effectors.</li>\n<li>Historically, research on the brain has been working its way in from the outside, going from sensation to action, hoping that some day it’ll take us through the middle.</li>\n<li>Whether it be phrenology or neuronal mechanisms, the basic approach has remained the same: to explain how human-constructed ideas relate to brain activity.</li>\n<li>Why would ideas from our predecessors hundreds or thousands of years ago map to the brain?</li>\n<li>We continue to refer to made-up words and concepts and look for their places in the brain by using lesion studies, imaging, and other methods.</li>\n<li>The boundaries between predetermined concepts guide the search rather than the relationships between interactive brain processes.</li>\n<li>The author refers to this approach as “neo-phrenology” or the “outside-in” strategy.</li>\n<li>Instead of explaining the invented terms (many of which date back to William James), we should be explaining the activities of the brain.</li>\n<li>The brain should be treated as an independent variable because behavior and cognition depend on brain activity, not the other way around.</li>\n<li>In the empiricism-inspired model, signals enter the brain from the outside, neuronal circuits process and perceive them, and then some other part of the brain decides whether or not to generate a motor response.</li>\n<li>The emphasis is on perceptual processing, association, and action generation.</li>\n<li>In the outside-in framework, the brain is fundamentally a passive device that perceives, evaluates, and decides whether and how to act. The author disagrees with this framework.</li>\n<li>Most contemporary computational models of brain function also fall under the outside-in framework.</li>\n<li>E.g. Marr’s three levels of analysis (computational, algorithmic, implementation).</li>\n<li>Behaviorism briefly challenged the outside-in framework by focusing on the action side of the sequence but it treated the brain as a black box.</li>\n<li>Stimulus, signal, and reinforcer typically mean different things to an experimenter, but do brains make such distinctions?</li>\n<li>Stimuli: inputs from the environment that arrive to the brain through sensory interfaces. It exerts some change in brain activity because it must stimulate the brain.</li>\n<li>Signal: the brain regards its change in response to the stimulus as important because it conveys something useful.</li>\n<li>Both stimulus and signal refer to a relationship between the outside world and brain activity.</li>\n<li>Conversely, the absence of such a relationship implies that the input doesn’t exist from the brain’s point of view.</li>\n<li>E.g. Many phenomena remain unnoticed by our brains either because we don’t have sensors for them, such as radio waves, or because we don’t attend to them, such as items in our peripheral vision.</li>\n<li>There’s nothing inherent in things/events that turn them into a stimulus/signal, only when they’re noticed by the brain do they become signals.</li>\n<li>Reinforcer: a special type of stimulus that changes an animal’s behavior.</li>\n<li>E.g. Positive or negative reinforcers.</li>\n<li>If something isn’t noticed by the brain, it’s irrelevant from the brain’s point of view; it doesn’t change it’s neuronal activity.</li>\n<li>Perhaps signals and reinforcers mean the same thing: they both convey change and relate the outside world to brain activity.</li>\n<li>Viewed this way, signals and reinforcers represent a scale where the ends are called positive or negative reinforcers while the middle are neutral signals.</li>\n<li>The brain didn’t evolve to represent anything but to help its host body survive and reproduce.</li>\n<li>Brains also produce many effects that don’t correspond to anything tangible in the physical world.</li>\n<li>E.g. Pleasure, fear, desire, color, and feelings.\n<a href=\"figure1-2.png\">Figure 1.2</a></li>\n<li>The brain isn’t a passive device that associates and fuses signals together to form objects.</li>\n<li>The problem with this outside-in correlational approach is that it doesn’t yield an adequate understand of perception or neuronal computation.</li>\n<li>Brain signals interpreted by an experimenter may not match the brain’s interpretation of those same signals.</li>\n<li>Only action can provide meaning to brain activity.</li>\n<li>There’s a difference between the observer outside the brain, such as the experimenter, and the observer inside the brain, such as the homunculus.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Typical visual system experiment</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An experimenter presents a visual stimulus to a subject.</li>\n<li>The image is then converted into APs and conveyed to the primary visual cortex.</li>\n<li>The experimenter places a recording devices inside the brain and monitors the neural responses to different stimuli.</li>\n<li>The experimenter can then correlate specific features of the presented images and the neuronal responses in the visual cortex, allowing them to guess at the possible input-output transformation rules.</li>\n<li>After establishing a correlation (often mistakenly called a neuronal code), the experimenter can recover stimulus properties from the neuronal responses and predict the properties of untested stimuli.</li>\n<li>In the end, a particular constellation of neuronal spike patterns becomes information.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>But to whom is that information useful?</li>\n<li>The recorded signals from the brain, combined with a priori knowledge about the stimulus, can only generate meaning to the experimenter, not the subject.</li>\n<li>What about the internal observers, the brain circuits? What do they see?</li>\n<li>They don’t see anything, all they see are spikes.</li>\n<li>Imagine an experimenter that has access to all neurons in the brain and their activity. Without access to information outside the skull, such knowledge can’t reveal what the brain is doing.</li>\n<li>In neural coding terms, the outside-in framework has only shown the decoding of stimulus properties from neural activity only if an observer has the code book (the set of stimulus-response correlations).</li>\n<li>However, the brain doesn’t have such a book; it only has its own neural responses.</li>\n<li>All any neuron in the brain ever sees is that some change happened in its upstream peers, whether that change was due to internal or external activity is unknown.</li>\n<li>Neurons in networks with other neurons don’t know what the brain’s sensors are sensing; they’re simply just responding to their upstream inputs.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Thought experiment</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suppose we connected a camera to a random blob of neurons in a petri dish.</li>\n<li>We may discover that repeated visual patterns will induce somewhat similar neuronal responses.</li>\n<li>It’s also possible that some members of the cultured neuronal network will be preoccupied with each other and ignore the stimulation altogether.</li>\n<li>So far, this is analogous to the passive, representational brain model used in many labs.</li>\n<li>Since the neurons in the culture have no direct access to the outside world, they have no way of verifying or grounding their patterns to outside events.</li>\n<li>However, the situation changes dramatically if the spiking output of some neurons is connected to a robot that can move the camera.</li>\n<li>Now the neurons in the dish have two functions: generating an output and responding to the camera signals.</li>\n<li>Since the culture is well interconnected, some neurons will receive inputs from both the camera and motor neurons, which informs them that their action caused some change in the sensory input.</li>\n<li>We’ve now closed the loop between sensation and action.</li>\n<li>Adding the robot provides the cultured neurons with the same advantage as the experimenter: neurons can now sense both the outside world and the internal computation, and can therefore compare their joint impact.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The internal feedback from the action-generating neurons to sensory neurons provides the grounding signal that attaches meaning to input-induced neuronal responses.</li>\n<li>While this is the minimum requirement of a brain-like system, random connections and plasticity aren’t enough.</li>\n<li>A large part of the brain’s structure is genetically determined and self-organized activity is as important for the development of the brain as sensory stimulation.</li>\n<li>Instead of the outside-in framework, the author proposes the inside-out framework.</li>\n<li>The main emphasis is on how the brain’s outputs, reflected in behavior, influence incoming signals.</li>\n<li>By linking an otherwise meaningless brain pattern to action, that pattern can gain meaning and significance to the organism.</li>\n<li>An action-perception loop learns to make sense of sensory inputs because no meaning or advantage emerges for the brain without the ability to calibrate neural patterns by behavior-induced consequences.</li>\n<li>In this view, brains largely organize themselves rather than be enslaved to input signals.</li>\n<li>Review of the tabula rasa (blank slate) assumption of the brain and how it’s false.</li>\n<li>Many experiments and studies today are still performed according to this assumption, often going under the name “connectionism”.</li>\n<li>Early behavioral observations already argued against the idea of the brain as a blank slate.</li>\n<li>E.g. Not all animals associate everything equally and not all can be trained to do all tricks. Behaviors that relate to an animal’s ecological niche can be easily trained because the brain is predisposed/prepared to do so.</li>\n<li>Experimental evidence from neuroscience also rules against the tabula rasa model because a lot of the brain’s activity is self-organized instead of being driven by outside signals.</li>\n<li>Instead of the tabula rasa model, the author proposes that learning doesn’t create new brain activity patterns from scratch, but instead is a fitting process where preexisting neuronal patterns are changed as needed.</li>\n<li>One advantage of a preconfigured brain is the stability of brain dynamics.</li>\n<li>Adding new experiences doesn’t perturb the overall state of neuronal networks and solves the catastrophic forgetting problem.</li>\n<li>In the preconfigured brain model, learning is a matching process where preexisting neuronal patterns, initially random, acquire meaning with the help of experience.</li>\n<li>Attaching meaning or significant to any neuronal pattern requires grounding, which can be provided for by action.</li>\n<li>Information isn’t inherent in computation (whether that be machines or brains) but becomes informative when it’s interpreted.</li>\n<li>Brains don’t process information, they create it.</li>\n<li>Coding is an agreement for communication between a sender and receiver, making the content of the encoded information private to outsiders unless they have the code book.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-2-causation-and-logic-in-neuroscience\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-2-causation-and-logic-in-neuroscience\" aria-label=\"chapter 2 causation and logic in neuroscience permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 2: Causation and Logic in Neuroscience</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hypotheses in neuroscience are often tested by models of associations between observed properties of the world.</li>\n<li>Review of interpolation = explanation = deduction and extrapolation = prediction = induction.</li>\n<li>Our choice to call one variable independent and the other dependent is often arbitrary and may reflect our preconceived bias.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Different nerves enter and leave the spinal cord for sensation and action.</li>\n<li>The brain maintains this anterior-posterior body segregation with the action area in front of the sensation area.</li>\n<li>Structures dedicated to perception mostly live in the posterior/back half of the human brain, while the structures dedicated to action mostly live in the anterior/front half.</li>\n<li>Sensation and perception are different.</li>\n<li>Sensation: the instantaneous feeling that receptors are being stimulated.</li>\n<li>Perception: compares sensation with memories of similar experience to identify the evoking stimulus.</li>\n<li>In the outside-in framework, sensory information goes to higher order cortical areas and then to motor areas.</li>\n<li>This route from sensation to action is often referred to as the “perception-action loop”.</li>\n<li>Decisions are made somewhere in the unexplained territory between sensory inputs and motor outputs.</li>\n<li>There’s no need for anatomical connections going in the opposite direction (but we know there are opposite direction connections in the form of efferent copies).</li>\n<li>One of the best known illusions is called apparent motion or the phi phenomenon.</li>\n<li>Phi phenomenon: the illusion of movement when stationary objects are placed side by side and illuminated one after another.</li>\n<li>E.g. Any loading symbol on modern computers and smartphones.</li>\n<li>In the phi phenomenon, the illumination is felt 25 ms or so before it’s actually changed.</li>\n<li>How can a perceptual effect occur before its physical cause?</li>\n<li>We don’t have a clear answer.</li>\n<li>Instead of asking why the brain can be fooled by artificial or rare patterns, we should instead ask why the brain reliably produces such illusions in the first place.</li>\n<li>Illusions aren’t mistakes but are due to the brain’s ability to efficiently and quickly extract important features.</li>\n<li>Why don’t we have a faster perceptual system?</li>\n<li>Because the bottleneck is action; there’s no reason to invest in speed if the muscle system that it controls is slow.</li>\n<li>The author argues that the distinction between “perception-action” and “action-perception” should favor the latter because from an evolutionary perspective, we can have action without perception but not vice versa.</li>\n<li>E.g. Jellyfish and ancient seawater animals can move without sensing much.</li>\n<li>We connect to the world not through our sensors (which are essential) but through our actions.</li>\n<li>The brain’s main function isn’t accurate and true perception and representation of the world, but to learn from the consequences of it’s actions about the aspects of the environment that matter for its goals, such as survival and reproduction.</li>\n<li>Review of efference copies also called corollary discharge.</li>\n<li>Corollary discharge: the mechanism that allow the sensory system to be informed about an action command.</li>\n<li>Neurons can’t interpret the relevance of signals conveyed by sensory inputs because they’re not grounded in some independent verification.</li>\n<li>There must be brain mechanisms that separate self-generated stimulation from externally-induced stimulation.</li>\n<li>Similar to the negative of a photograph, the stimulation from a sensor during the movement is the positive print that’s canceled by the corollary discharge of the negative print.</li>\n<li>Thus, action directly influences sensation.</li>\n<li>The corollary discharge is an invention by the brain.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two types of corollary discharge</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Adaptive filtering: filtering out self-generated signals using a corollary discharge synchronized with motor production.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Cricket’s inhibit sensing their own chirping which lets them be fully alert while chirping at loud sounds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Time division: when a corollary discharge and signal detection occur at different times.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. During a blink or saccadic eye movements, inputs from the world disappear or get blurred but we don’t notice it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Sampling the world, instead of continuously detecting it, has some advantages.</li>\n<li>E.g. Blurred vision is prevented during a saccade because visual input is suppressed. Corollary discharges help coordinate neural activity. Suppressed spiking conserves resources and allows the visual system to be more sensitive after a saccade.</li>\n<li>Sampling may have evolved due to muscle constraints.</li>\n<li>E.g. A muscle’s fastest reaction is a twitch followed by a refractory period.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other advantages of sampling</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduces a way to chunk information, similar to spaces between words.</li>\n<li>Simplifies information processing and introduces a clear time reference frame.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The interesting case of AI, who couldn’t make eye saccades due to unusable eye muscles, compensated for frozen eyes by making head saccades. Although slower, AI’s saccade strategy is the same as a normal person.</li>\n<li>Active sensing: a brain-initiated search in contrast to responding to an expected event.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two forms of active sensing</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moving the entire body</li>\n<li>Moving the sensors</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Both forms of active sensing can be exploited by the same animal.</li>\n<li>Review of electrolocation in weakly electric fish and echolocation in bats.</li>\n<li>Smelling is another elegant example of active sensing in animals.</li>\n<li>E.g. Sniffing optimally samples the odorant by generating turbulence so that odorants that normally slowly diffuse come into direct contact with the olfactory receptor.</li>\n<li>Eye movements improve the visual performance of the sensory system and helps to maintain perception during visual fixation.</li>\n<li>Saccades can be considered as “visual sniffs” that improve seeing.</li>\n<li>Another example of when sensing self-generated action is useful is during speech.</li>\n<li>Auditory feedback is very useful in speech to distinguish external sounds from self-generated sounds.</li>\n<li>Auditory regions also receive direct projections from motor areas, providing the necessary pathway for conveying corollary discharge signals.</li>\n<li>These signals strongly suppress both spontaneous and tone-evoked synaptic activity by using a feed-forward inhibitory mechanism that activates inhibitory interneurons in the auditory cortex.</li>\n<li>One could argue that sensation doesn’t require action because you can just sit there and experience the world without moving.</li>\n<li>However, such perception happens in an already calibrated brain where meaning has already been placed in a memory store.</li>\n<li>So we don’t need to actively sense stimuli because we’ve already done it before.</li>\n<li>Random kicks while the baby is in the womb is used to test the limits of the baby’s body to prune the brain.</li>\n<li>The initially meaningless, action-induced feedback from sensors transduces the spatial layout of the body into temporal spiking relationships among neurons in the brain.</li>\n<li>This is how the brain acquires knowledge of the body it controls.</li>\n<li>Once the body scheme is built, the relationships between spindles and muscle jerks mostly disappears but may show up occasionally as whole-body jerks just before sleep.</li>\n<li>Thus, action teach perception; perception is an action-based process, an exploration initiated by the brain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-4-neuronal-assembly-the-fundamental-unit-of-communication\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-4-neuronal-assembly-the-fundamental-unit-of-communication\" aria-label=\"chapter 4 neuronal assembly the fundamental unit of communication permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 4: Neuronal Assembly: The Fundamental Unit of Communication</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A single neuron is thought to be the fundamental unit of computation in the brain.</li>\n<li>But that doesn’t seem right since one neuron can change functions, may die, and combining the responses of multiple neurons doesn’t account for changes due to feedback.</li>\n<li>E.g.

In turn, the phase of the faster rhythm modulates the amplitude of an even faster one and so on.</li>\n<li>An analogy is that the four seasons of the year modulate both the amplitude and duration of day length.</li>\n<li>Because of cross-frequency coupling, the duration of the fastest event is limited by the phase range of the slower event.</li>\n<li>E.g. Ultrafast oscillations in the hippocampus are phase-locked to the spikes of both pyramidal cells and interneurons and modulated by thalamocortical sleep spindles. Sleep spindles, in turn, are phase-modulated by cortical delta oscillations.</li>\n<li>The nested nature of brain rhythms may represent the needed structure for syntactic rules, allowing for both message separation and linking into neuronal words and sentences.</li>\n<li>All neuronal oscillations are based on inhibition.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three classes of inhibitory interneurons</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Innervates the axon’s initial segment and can influence the timing of spikes.</li>\n<li>Innervates the region surrounding the cell body and can segregate dendrites from axons.</li>\n<li>Dendritic inhibition and can filter out excitatory inputs onto different dendritic segments.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Inhibition of excitatory neurons can be thought of as the punctuation marks of neural syntax because they can parse and segregate neuronal messages.</li>\n<li>The coordinated action of interneurons can route excitatory information at the right time and to the right place.</li>\n<li>Inhibition is the foundation of brain rhythms as the balance between excitation and inhibition is most efficiently achieved through oscillations.</li>\n<li>Oscillations can transform both interconnected and unconnected neuron groups into temporary coalitions, providing flexibility and economical use of spikes.</li>\n<li>Due to axonal conduction delays, slow waves are larger and involve many neurons in many brain areas, whereas fast waves are smaller and involve local neurons.</li>\n<li>The consequence is that perturbations at slow frequencies affect all nested oscillations.</li>\n<li>However, this also means that the brain can integrate many distributed local processes into globally ordered states.</li>\n<li>E.g. Local computations can be under the control of more global brain activity such as attention, executive function, or top-down control.</li>\n<li>Oscillations also coordinate input and output neurons as there are ideal and non-ideal phases in an oscillation.</li>\n<li>E.g. It’s easier to send a message during the excitation phase (ideal) than the inhibition phase (non-ideal).</li>\n<li>This also impacts the timing of output spikes by synchronizing cell assembly activity and chunking information.</li>\n<li>Rhythms (neural oscillations) are surprisingly conserved throughout evolution, suggesting a fundamental role for temporal coordination of neuronal activity.</li>\n<li>Every known pattern of LFP, oscillatory or intermittent, in one mammalian species is also found in virtually all other mammals.</li>\n<li>E.g.
