Computers were thought to be brain-like and not that brains were computer-like.</li>\n<li>The first two layers of the retina are surprising because they don’t use spikes to talk; they talk directly in flickers of voltage and diffusions of chemicals.</li>\n<li>Review of cones, bipolar, and ganglion cells.</li>\n<li>The retina isn’t a passive collector of light, but a complex mini-brain.</li>\n<li>The lack of spikes in the eye means the neurons there can’t be doing the logical operations believed by MP.</li>\n<li>If the retina doesn’t need spikes, why do neurons send spikes?</li>\n<li>Why convert the flexible, continuous, analogue signal of molecules and voltage into a rigid, discrete, digital one? Why throw away information?</li>\n<li>The answer is that spikes let neurons send information accurately, fast, and far.</li>\n<li>A spike is a time stamp that says “a thing just happened now”: an event.</li>\n<li>That thing might be a change in light intensity or the pitch of a sound.</li>\n<li>In general, spikes signal change.</li>\n<li>A spike takes less than a millisecond to make, so they’re resolution/accuracy is extremely good for time stamping events in the world.</li>\n<li>E.g. A rat’s whiskers are accurate to five microseconds.</li>\n<li>The faster the movement, the more accurate the spikes it evoked would need to be to capture such movement.</li>\n<li>Fast events require fast communication.</li>\n<li>Spikes are the brain’s solution to the problem of sending information quickly.</li>\n<li>Almost all neurons have a single axon sprouting from them and some of these axons are custom built for speed.</li>\n<li>Spikes are twenty times faster than if neurons used only voltage for signaling (graded potentials) and a thousand times faster than chemical messaging.</li>\n<li>Plus, sending graded potentials increases the chance for message corruption due to noise.</li>\n<li>After a hundred or more passing, the message would be ruined like in the game of telephone.</li>\n<li>Spikes let the whiskers update the rat’s brain and then feet, accurately and quickly.</li>\n<li>Big bodies need their neurons to send messages over long distances.</li>\n<li>Spikes are the brain’s solution to the distance problem too.</li>\n<li>Axons connecting nearby neurons are thin, while axons connecting distant neurons are thick.</li>\n<li>The longer the axon, the thicker it is, so the spike travels faster.</li>\n<li>Another solution is to use a myelin sheath.</li>\n<li>Sending distant messages using any other way is doomed to failure.</li>\n<li>E.g. Giraffes are only possible due to spikes.</li>\n<li>Spikes are accurate, fast, and far.</li>\n<li>What the eye tells the brain is a complex, but simplified, breakdown of everything that’s out there.</li>\n<li>The activity of cones encode the location of sources of light in the outside world.</li>\n<li>Spikes from the ganglion cells automatically tell the brain about location.</li>\n<li>When they’re sent, spikes just mean that there’s a different pattern of light at this location, and the location above it, and all along this direction in a straight line.</li>\n<li>After location, the retina’s next fundamental bit of information is when light is on or off at a particular location.</li>\n<li>Review of ON, OFF, and ON-OFF retinal ganglion cells.</li>\n<li>This was a killer blow to the MP idea of neurons as logical computers since the retina does this much computation without spikes.</li>\n<li>A lot of computation, but no logic.</li>\n<li>There are at least 32 different types of ganglion cells in the mouse eye; we don’t know exactly for humans.</li>\n<li>And whatever they respond to, each type of ganglion cell tiles the retina.</li>\n<li>\n<p>What’s the purpose of all of these types?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They exist to send messages that solve very specific problems.</li>\n<li>They’re not selective, but instead model one aspect of the world that’s common and regular.</li>\n<li>They exist to signal to the brain how much your head is moving to move your eyes and counteract the head movement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>However, most ganglion cell types aren’t selective to solve the specific problems of coordinating your body.</li>\n<li>Rather, they each take care of common features in our world, which depends on what that animal calls home.</li>\n<li>Different species have different niches, which requires different ganglion cells.</li>\n<li>\n<p>For humans, when compared to mice</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We definitely have a few types mice don’t since we have a third type of cone.</li>\n<li>By gene definition, we have twenty compared to the mouse’s forty.</li>\n<li>We have a fovea that mice don’t.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When we see something, our retina splits the image into tens of separate channels of information.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-3-legion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-3-legion\" aria-label=\"chapter 3 legion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 3: Legion</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The spikes from the eye then enter layer four of the cortex.</li>\n<li>Layer one of the cortex, near the surface of the brain, has few neurons and is mostly filled with axons and glia cells.</li>\n<li>The shape of a neuron’s dendrite tree, and how many trees it has, tells us a lot about what that neuron is trying to do.</li>\n<li>Review of synapses and neurotransmitters.</li>\n<li>Exactly what effect each arriving spike has on the dendrites depends on what type of molecule is sent across the gap.</li>\n<li>It seems wasteful that each spike is created only to be destroyed at the synapse.</li>\n<li>The key reason is flexibility.

More sensitive means more vesicles released.</li>\n<li>Since you can’t make a reliable synapse more reliable, you have to start off unreliable to allow headroom for change.</li>\n<li>This implies that for learning, the brain is deliberately noisy in order to allow for learning.</li>\n<li>Learning becomes the routing of reliable spikes.</li>\n<li>Maybe unreliable synapses solve the problem of how to transmit as much information as possible with as little energy as possible.</li>\n<li>Synapses and their machinery take up about 56 percent of all energy used by neurons in the brain.</li>\n<li>Failure brings down the information rate of the neuron’s input to match the capacity of the neuron’s output axon.</li>\n<li>It turns out that the failure rate, in theory, should be around 75 percent, which is exactly what we see in the cortex.</li>\n<li>Synaptic failure also reduces sending redundant information, which maximizes the amount of information per unit energy.</li>\n<li>This redundancy theory predicts that the more contacts a neuron makes on a target neuron, the more unreliable those synapses should be. And this prediction is true.</li>\n<li>The more synapses a neuron makes on another, the higher the failure rate of those synapses.</li>\n<li>Synaptic failure could be a neuron’s greatest hack for optimizing the efficiency of energy and communication.</li>\n<li>Failure can also be used to throttle the rate of vesicles release to sequential spikes.</li>\n<li>E.g. The first spike used up a lot of the vesicles so subsequent spikes have less to use and are therefore more unreliable.</li>\n<li>This means that the strength of the synapse becomes progressively weaker to later spikes in a sequence.</li>\n<li>This is known as short-term depression.</li>\n<li>The opposite, when the first spike primes following spikes, is known as short-term facilitation.</li>\n<li>With these short-term operations, the receiving neuron can compute things based on sequences of spikes.</li>\n<li>E.g. If two spikes occur within X milliseconds on a synapse with short-term facilitation, the receiving neuron knows this even though the first spike never occurred.</li>\n<li>In effect, synaptic failure allows the brain to compute with ghosts, spikes that were never there.</li>\n<li>It also allows neurons to filter spikes by breaking oscillations. This may also be how brains prevent seizures.</li>\n<li>Review of the superior colliculus (SC) as a threat detector and the periaqueductal gray (PeGy) as the controller of rapid reactions.</li>\n<li>The unreliable connections between the SC and PeGy control the decision to flee or not, it is the threshold.</li>\n<li>Another proposed reason for synaptic failure is to introduce noise into the brain for learning and searching.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Like in ML, noise is good for</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generalizing what you’ve learned.</li>\n<li>Searching for the best solution to a problem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Maybe synaptic failure is the “dropout” for the brain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-6-the-dark-neuron-problem\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-6-the-dark-neuron-problem\" aria-label=\"chapter 6 the dark neuron problem permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 6: The Dark Neuron Problem</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Like the night sky, most of the neurons aren’t firing.</li>\n<li>The overwhelming majority don’t send anything.</li>\n<li>Sending 500 spikes per second is the theoretical limit for neurons.</li>\n<li>Evidence shows that the most active neurons in the cortex can only sustain a continuous output of about 30 spikes per second.</li>\n<li>There seems to be a paradox in that neurons in the cortex are sending spikes an order of magnitude lower than they should be if all of their inputs were similarly active.</li>\n<li>The only solution to this paradox is that most inputs to a neuron aren’t sending spikes.</li>\n<li>The irony is that dark neurons are essential to being able to record from neurons at all.

Long-term potentiation.</li>\n<li>Then a neuron needs to receive just a few spikes to make a new one.</li>\n<li>Spontaneous spikes help by causing voltage blips in many neurons, driving up their voltage.</li>\n<li>Thus, spontaneous spikes are there to assist spikes evoked by the outside world.</li>\n<li>However, there are issues with this hypothesis.</li>\n<li>E.g. They are random and they use huge amounts of energy as mere helpers for evoked spikes.</li>\n<li>The evidence that spontaneous spikes use so much energy suggests that the brain has a much better way of putting them to work.</li>\n<li>We think that spontaneous spikes are already carrying most of the information the brain needs to act. They’re prediction.</li>\n<li>This also explains why the brain uses a mostly constant amount of energy regardless of the task.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spontaneity for prediction</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prediction is crucial for much of what we do. Based on what happened before, this is what’s most likely to happen next.</li>\n<li>Our brain turns experience into prediction.</li>\n<li>One non-obvious experience that we’ve all had to learn is seeing.</li>\n<li>The development of the visual system takes a long time.</li>\n<li>The statistics of the visual world are all learned by experience.</li>\n<li>E.g. Raise someone in a world without vertical lines and they can’t see a vertical object. Close one eye during development and when reopened, that eye will see nothing.</li>\n<li>Deprived of the experience of vertical lines and there are no neurons tuned to vertical lines.</li>\n<li>Neurons learn about edges, corner, and curves through experience.</li>\n<li>The set of neurons you have in your visual cortex exactly reflects the statistics of the visible world you grew up in.</li>\n<li>Which means your brain can turn this lifetime of experience into prediction.</li>\n<li>Spontaneous spikes made those predictions.</li>\n<li>These predictive spontaneous spikes solve the speed limit problem because then we don’t need all of the spikes from the retina, V1, etc. to start processing.</li>\n<li>In essence, the brain guesses with incomplete information to be faster.</li>\n<li>Because spontaneous spikes are already there in each brain area, most areas are already predicting most of the world.</li>\n<li>How exactly does this prediction happen?</li>\n<li>Feedback connections do the predicting.</li>\n<li>Each brain region isn’t sending its processed output that reflects reality, it’s sending its processed guess.</li>\n<li>This also explains some visual illusions.</li>\n<li>Working backwards, descending spikes are predicting features that should be in the world if each guess is true. They predict by deconstruction.</li>\n<li>So the spikes descending from Highway What ultimately predict what information should be arriving in V1 from the eye.</li>\n<li>This also explains the priming effect.</li>\n<li>So, input from the eye only adjusts what’s wrong with the prediction.</li>\n<li>Since most of the predictions will be correct, because experience has fine tuned our visual system, there won’t be much to adjust.</li>\n<li>The spontaneous spikes just tell the rest of the brain what’s there in the world before your eye has ever seen it.</li>\n<li>This theory also goes by the name of Bayesian hierarchical inference, bootstrapping, and educated guessing.</li>\n<li>It means that seeing can be so fast that you don’t notice it happening; the information is already there and adjusted by the input.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Prediction is used to guide behavior and can be created from few examples.</li>\n<li>Theories on how the brain makes decisions propose that spontaneous activity affects future decisions because that activity encodes prior information.</li>\n<li>Given this body’s experience, this is what my current prediction is.</li>\n<li>Predictions can be used as a starting point to make fast and accurate decisions; they’re heuristics.</li>\n<li>A memory buffer is also part of prediction as to gain entry into the buffer, the new stimulus must be either new, odd, surprising, or useful.</li>\n<li>Attention can be thought of as signaling that that stimulus will be useful in the future.</li>\n<li>Another supporting piece of evidence is that we know working memory is maintained by the spontaneous activity of neurons in the prefrontal cortex.</li>\n<li>Long after the evoking stimulus, these neurons are sending spikes to each other.</li>\n<li>Maybe dreaming is a way of consolidating memories from spontaneous spikes into a more durable form like LTP, synaptic weights, or new neurons/connections.</li>\n<li>Spontaneous spikes before movement are also seemingly predictive of what movement will be.</li>\n<li>There’s nothing unique about the spikes evoked by events in the outside world.</li>\n<li>In an experiment with infant ferrets, the animals were shown two different visual scenes: darkness and a movie of the natural world. The infant ferrets had vastly different patterns of spikes between movies and darkness but these converged over development.</li>\n<li>By natural, we mean stimuli with curves, edges, color, motion, etc.</li>\n<li>Thus, development may be the process of refining the brain’s predictions; of refining spontaneous activity.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Model of how the brain works</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spikes coming in from the outside world adjust spontaneous activity, and these adjustments are the message they carry.</li>\n<li>So spikes don’t signal changes in the world, they signal changes in prediction, deviation from the baseline that is prediction.</li>\n<li>That’s why in mature brains, the distribution of how many spikes each neuron sends barely changes between spontaneous and evoked activity.</li>\n<li>This implies that information isn’t coded in the pattern, timing, or number of spikes evoked by the outside world, it’s coded by changes in the ongoing spontaneous spikes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Maybe spontaneous spikes were selected for by evolution as a byproduct of simply making a network of neurons.</li>\n<li>Evolution co-opted spontaneous spikes to prime responses or anticipate needs.</li>\n<li>The most important journey for the spike is not from input to output, it’s the eternal cycle of looping forever within the brain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-11-the-future-of-spikes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-11-the-future-of-spikes\" aria-label=\"chapter 11 the future of spikes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 11: The Future of Spikes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We can predict the new directions that we want to explore with spikes.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two missing pieces</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spikes that underlie disorders of the brain.</li>\n<li>Spikes that underlie human thought processes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There’s a race to record from as many spikes and neurons simultaneously.</li>\n<li>Neuroscience has a version of Moore’s law but for the number of simultaneously recorded neurons doubling every few years.</li>\n<li>By recording from many neurons at the same time, we know that our theories about how the brain works will change.</li>\n<li>One new technology that will push our ability to record spikes is called voltage imaging.</li>\n<li>One day, we’ll be able to record every single spike sent by every single neuron in the entire cortex.
