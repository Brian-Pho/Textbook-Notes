Neurons are locked in a competition for survival.</li>\n<li>As the border wars rage throughout the lifetime of a brain, maps are redrawn so that the experiences and goals of a person are always reflected in their brain’s structure.</li>\n<li>E.g. If an accountant switches her career to become a pianist, then the territory devoted to fingers grows and the territory devoted to numbers shrinks.</li>\n<li>The brain distributes its resources according to what’s important and does so by implementing a do-or-die competition among all the parts that make it up.</li>\n<li>Brains constantly change themselves to reflect its challenges and goals.</li>\n<li>\n<p>When it doesn’t have what it needs, it makes it. Why?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speed. By reconfiguring the neural wiring, tasks like typing become automated, allowing fast decisions and actions.

Why does the phenomenon of phantom limb exist? Why does touching the face sometimes feel like someone is touching the amputated arm?</li>\n<li>The answer is that touch to the hand isn’t only represented by the cells in the somatosensory cortex, but also by the cells they talk to downstream, and the cells they talk too, and so on.</li>\n<li>In a child, the map would be entirely different but in an adult, the system has less flexibility to rewrite its fate.</li>\n<li>When inputs suddenly cease, sensory cortical areas are invaded by their neighbours.</li>\n<li>How does the brain keep constant track of what the body looks like?</li>\n<li>Timing is everything. Neurons that fire together, wire together.</li>\n<li>The same is true all over your body, neighbouring patches will tend to be more co-active than patches that aren’t.</li>\n<li>Neurons that are active close in time to one another tend to make and maintain connections between themselves.</li>\n<li>Close in time results in close in space.</li>\n<li>Why does the map change when the input changes?</li>\n<li>When a part of the body no longer sends information, it loses territory. Just like colonization.</li>\n<li>Not just the body, this rule applies to any system sending information to the brain.</li>\n<li>E.g. The visual cortex in blind people handles reading braille.</li>\n<li>Brain regions care about solving certain types of tasks, irrespective of the sensory channel by which information arrives.</li>\n<li>Age matters. The older the brain, the less flexible it is for redeployment.</li>\n<li>When a sense captures more area, does that give it greater capabilities?</li>\n<li>Yes the more brain real estate, the better the capabilities.</li>\n<li>E.g. Blind people have exceptional sound skills compared to sighted people. They have better sound localization and better pitch perception.</li>\n<li>E.g. Color-blind people are better at distinguishing between different shades of gray.</li>\n<li>E.g. Amputees have a finer sensation on the stump of the lost limb.</li>\n<li>Because the brain is now devoting more territory to the remaining undamaged areas, sensing becomes higher resolution.</li>\n<li>Neural redeployment replaces the old paradigm of predetermined brain areas with something more flexible.</li>\n<li>There’s nothing special about visual cortex neurons, they’re simply neurons that happen to be connected to the eyes.</li>\n<li>This isn’t quite true as there seems to be some genetic component that makes visual cortex neurons better handle visual data.</li>\n<li>Neural reorganization happens rapidly in the order of days and hours.</li>\n<li>Neural flexibility allows brains to optimize performance in a variety of environments.</li>\n<li>Why do brains dream?</li>\n<li>We know that sensory deprivation triggers neighbouring territories to take over. So how does the visual system deal with this unfair disadvantage?</li>\n<li>One way is by keeping the occipital cortex active during the night through dreaming.</li>\n<li>Author suggests that dreams exists to keep the visual cortex from being taken over.</li>\n<li>The rotation of the planet doesn’t affect anything about your ability to touch, hear, taste, or smell; only vision suffers in the dark.</li>\n<li>During most of the night, there is no dreaming except in REM sleep.</li>\n<li>REM sleep is triggered by a particular set of neurons in the brainstem called the pons.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The pons has two functions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paralyze the body to prevent the body from acting out its dreams.</li>\n<li>Send waves of spikes to the occipital lobe.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When the spikes arrive, the activity is experienced as visual. We see. This is why dreams are pictorial and filmic instead of conceptual or abstract.</li>\n<li>Dreams may be the strange love child of neural plasticity and the rotation of the planet.</li>\n<li>A key point is that this nighttime volley of activity is only directed at the occipital cortex through the lateral geniculate nucleus.</li>\n<li>From this theory, it’s no surprise that a person born blind has dreams not about visual experiences, but about other sensory experiences such as feeling their way around a room or hearing strange animals barking.</li>\n<li>Another piece of supporting evidence is that species born immature have much more REM sleep compared to animals born mature aka with a solidified brain.</li>\n<li>Also, REM sleep decreases with age.

Electromagnetic radiation is light, air compression waves are sound, heat and texture is touch, and chemical signals are smell.</li>\n<li>In the end, it all gets translated into the common currency of spikes.</li>\n<li>We have evidence for this as some babies are born without a nose or eyes; no peripherals for a sense of smell or sight.</li>\n<li>The extraordinary list of the ways that we can be disassembled goes on.</li>\n<li>E.g. Children born without ears, pain receptors, and touch.</li>\n<li>Random mutations introduce strange new sensors, but the brain doesn’t have to be redesigned.</li>\n<li>Once the principles of brain operation have been established, nature can simply worry about designing new sensors.</li>\n<li>The sensory organs that we have aren’t the only collection that we could have.</li>\n<li><em>Sensory substitution</em>: feed information into the brain via unusual pathways.</li>\n<li>Sensory substitution improved drastically when the camera was allowed to move under the control of the patient.</li>\n<li>Sensory input is best learned when one can interact with the world.</li>\n<li>It closes the loop between muscle output and sensory input.</li>\n<li>From the sensory organs to the brain and from the brain to the brain, all inputs are converted into the common currency of electrical signals.</li>\n<li>What if cortical specialization develops from the details of the incoming data cables rather than by genetics?</li>\n<li>The data makes the area.</li>\n<li>This is why the neocortex looks the same everywhere, because it is the same.</li>\n<li>In 2000, scientists at MIT redirected inputs from a ferret’s eye to the auditory cortex. What happened?</li>\n<li>The auditory cortex adjusted its circuitry to resemble the connections of the primary visual cortex.</li>\n<li>This tells us that the pattern of inputs determines the fate of the cortex.</li>\n<li>The brain dynamically wires itself to best represent whatever its input data (related to mastery).</li>\n<li><em>Tongue grid</em>: an electrical grid placed on the tongue that sends out electrical signals depending on what an external camera sees.</li>\n<li>The tongue grid reminds us that vision arises not in the eyes but in the brain.</li>\n<li>Even though all the activity is at the surface of your sensory detectors, you perceive everything as out there.</li>\n<li>You don’t consciously convert the substitution into its original stimuli, you directly experience the stimuli without conscious processing (after training).</li>\n<li>E.g. You don’t consciously perceive light as photons, but as a conscious experience that occurs outside the brain.</li>\n<li>The improvements in a user’s sensory substitution performance are paralleled by the amount of cerebral reorganization.</li>\n<li>The brain figures out how to extract information from incoming signals, regardless of the path by which those signals get into the brain.</li>\n<li>All that matters is the information they carry.</li>\n<li>The skin is a mind-bogglingly sophisticated computational material that we don’t use for much in modern life.</li>\n<li>It’s vast surface area and complex sensors for pressure, vibration, temperature, and pain, compared to vision and sound, are rarely used in modern life.</li>\n<li>E.g. The Neosensory vest converts sound into patterns of vibration on the skin.</li>\n<li>Deaf children can use the vest to learn to vocalize because it closes a loop: they make a noise and immediately register it as a sensory input.</li>\n<li>This also know as an efference copy and normal people also use the same method to learn to speak.</li>\n<li>E.g. As babies, we babbled, cooed, and made strange sounds to get feedback.</li>\n<li>A little-known fact is that people with prosthetic legs have to do a lot of work to learn how to walk because they receive no feedback from the leg.</li>\n<li>E.g. Where the leg is, how stretched it is, and where the knee is.</li>\n<li>Beyond sensory substitution is sensory enhancement. What if we could make our current senses better, wider, or faster?</li>\n<li>Some human females have four colour photoreceptors and see more colors than the typical human.</li>\n<li>Mice and squirrel monkeys have been genetically engineered to have color vision.</li>\n<li>New sensors show that tradition is irrelevant when it comes to biology.</li>\n<li>We can extend ourselves beyond our inherited genetics.</li>\n<li>Beyond sensory substitution and beyond sensor enhancement is sensory addition.</li>\n<li>E.g. Adding a magnet to your finger to sense magnetic fields.</li>\n<li>The effects outlasted the technology as internal whispers of signal can get strengthened when an external device confirms them.</li>\n<li>Because we live in a world bloated with information now, it’s likely that we’re going to have to transition from accessing big data to experiencing it directly.</li>\n<li>E.g. Imagine yourself plugged into a factory with dozens of machines. You become the factory and can sense issues that aren’t visible since you have more data.</li>\n<li>Big data gives deeper patterns of insight.</li>\n<li>E.g. Imagine feeding real-time patient data into a surgeon’s back or the ISS health into an astronaut’s back. You can replace staring at monitors with different patterns of touch, summarizing data and making it more intuitive and experiential.</li>\n<li>Even beyond sensory addition is shared perception.</li>\n<li>This has the potential for unlocking a new depth of mutual understanding.</li>\n<li>All of this works because we don’t become aware of our senses unless our expectations are violated.</li>\n<li>E.g. Seeing the eye’s blind spot or feeling a rock in your shoe.</li>\n<li>We could also just add new senses by directly stimulating the brain.</li>\n<li>We’ve talked a lot about getting new data into the brain, but what would it feel like?</li>\n<li>An unanswered question in neuroscience: why does vision feel so different from smell?</li>\n<li>It can’t be because these areas are genetically built differently because we can rewire these areas to a different sensory organ.</li>\n<li>One answer is that the subjective experience of a sense is determined by the structure of the data.</li>\n<li>I believe the answer is that the pathway of the information determines the meaning of the signal.</li>\n<li>Qualia are shaped by the way your motor outputs change the sensory inputs.</li>\n<li>E.g. Visual data changes as you move your eye muscles. Sound data changes as you move your head. Taste data changes as you eat something.</li>\n<li>As long as there is clear structure to the data and a feedback loop, the data should give rise to new qualia.</li>\n<li>In the same way you can’t imagine a new color, you can’t imagine a new sense.</li>\n<li>We had to learn to use our current sensory organs and the same is true for new sensory organs.</li>\n<li>The fact that we can’t imagine a new color is extraordinarily revealing.</li>\n<li>It shows us the boundary of qualia.</li>\n<li>To understand vision requires experiencing vision.</li>\n<li>Language can only communicate shared experiences. It’s also true that if the experience isn’t shared, you can’t communicate it.</li>\n<li>E.g. Telling a blind person what it’s like to see color. Sure, you can use analogies but it isn’t the same as experiencing it.</li>\n<li>Given the finite territory in the brain, is it possible that each added sense will reduce the resolution of the others, such that your new sensory powers come at the cost of slightly worse hearing and vision?</li>\n<li>We don’t know, but I hypotheses that yes, adding new senses decreases other sense resolution.</li>\n<li>Emotions simply reflect the meaning of the data to you.</li>\n<li>E.g. Pizza smells good because it predicts a high energy food, while a rotten smell predicts disease and pathogens.</li>\n<li>Many emotional examples have evolved in evolutionary timescales but some come from experiences.</li>\n<li>We are no longer a natural species that has to wait millions of years for Mother Nature’s next sensory gift.</li>\n<li>This chapter has only talked about input but what about output?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-5-how-to-get-a-better-body\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-5-how-to-get-a-better-body\" aria-label=\"chapter 5 how to get a better body permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 5: How to Get a Better Body</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Just like the sensory system, when a limb is no longer available for control, the cortical area devoted to it shrinks.</li>\n<li>The brain reorganizes to match its new body plan.</li>\n<li>The main principle: motor areas optimize themselves to drive the available machinery.</li>\n<li>Returning to the Potato Head model of the brain, various output devices can be attached and the brain will automatically figure out how to use it.</li>\n<li>And just like how small genetic changes can give rise to weird new sensory organs, genetic mutations can also give rise to new limbs such as a new arm or tail.</li>\n<li>Brains adjust to the opportunities of the body.</li>\n<li>E.g.

This is also known as the motion aftereffect.</li>\n<li>This happens because neurons in the brain encoding directions of motion are locked in a constant battle and most of the time, they evenly inhibit each other. But when you get used to the motion, your brain recalibrates itself.</li>\n<li>After staring for a while, your brain recalibrates and believes that this is the new normal. Sort of like a brain homeostasis.</li>\n<li>The system always wants to set up a ground truth so that it can be better at detecting change.</li>\n<li><em>Troxler effect</em>: when fixated on a point, the periphery will disappear.</li>\n<li>The visual system is always seeking motion and change.</li>\n<li>Good information is expected to update; things that don’t change are ignored by the system.</li>\n<li>The fundamental fact is that brains only care about change.</li>\n<li>But if it doesn’t change, then brains ignore it.</li>\n<li>Are parts of the world invisible to us that should be obvious?</li>\n<li>E.g. Our retina’s blind spot or maybe some constant cosmic rain that we’ve all ignored from birth.</li>\n<li>Successful adaptation makes regularities invisible.</li>\n<li>Another way to look at this is as prediction.</li>\n<li>If an input pattern is predictable, the system saves energy by structuring itself around that input so as not to be surprised by it.</li>\n<li>Many neuroscientists think that the activity of neurons as representing things in the world but it could turn out that the truth is exactly the opposite, that spikes are the unpredictable parts.</li>\n<li>The system makes adjustments only when it gets surprised.</li>\n<li>The deeper principle here is that your brain is striving to build an internal model of the outside world.</li>\n<li>Attention is the mechanism that lets you focus on build your model around surprising stimuli.</li>\n<li>If you’re predicting perfectly, your brain doesn’t need to change further and it saves energy.</li>\n<li>An internal model of the world allows a machine to make its best guesses about the events that are expected to occur.</li>\n<li>This explains why people become desensitized or tolerant to drugs over time. The brain comes to predict the presence of the drug and adapts to maintain a stable equilibrium or homeostasis.</li>\n<li>Like plants working toward maximizing sunlight (phototropism), brains may work towards maximizing information/surprise (infotropism).</li>\n<li>The brain fine-tunes its circuitry to maximize the data it streams from the world.</li>\n<li>The system works out how to optimize its interaction with the world.</li>\n<li>E.g. The retina has two sets of photo receptors to optimize its capture of light.</li>\n<li>Fundamentally, the brain is a prediction machine.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-8-balancing-on-the-edge-of-change\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-8-balancing-on-the-edge-of-change\" aria-label=\"chapter 8 balancing on the edge of change permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 8: Balancing on the Edge of Change</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Our brain regions only appear stable because they’re locked in a cold war, but everything’s on a hair-triggers edge.</li>\n<li>When a brain loses territory to disease, damage, or surgery, what happens to the available territory?</li>\n<li>Does the brain leave out the damaged area or does it squish it into its current territory?</li>\n<li>Evidence from the case of Alice, a child missing her right hemisphere, shows that the latter is true, territory is shared/squished in the remaining area.</li>\n<li>Alice’s visual system rewired to allow both the left and right visual fields to be represented in the single remaining hemisphere.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

Once the door shuts, large-scale change is over.</li>\n<li>The threshold is around 8 years old for learning to speak a language without an accent.</li>\n<li>The same goes for speaking with an accent. If you arrive at the country before 8-10 years old, you’ll learn the language without an accent.</li>\n<li>The influence of developmental timing is found across all the senses.</li>\n<li>The brain needs to experience the proper input within the right window to achieve its most useful connectivity.</li>\n<li>We are highly influenced by events in our childhood.</li>\n<li>Sensitive periods are different for different tasks.</li>\n<li>The reason may be because different sensitive periods are caused by different underlying learning strategies.</li>\n<li>The degree of plasticity in a brain region reflects how much its input data changes.</li>\n<li>Stable data solidifies first, while unstable data solidifies last.</li>\n<li>E.g. Sound data is mostly consistent while body data changes as we go through puberty and get stronger, weaker, fatter, thinner, or use new equipment. So the auditory cortex becomes solid faster than the somatosensory cortex.</li>\n<li>This plasticity-reflects-variance hypothesis has an analogy in genetics as core genes are protected and stable, while variable genes are allowed to vary more to account for changes such as skin pigmentation due to different latitudes.</li>\n<li>An active mental life fosters new connections.</li>\n<li>Another reason for being less adaptable when we’re older is because the brain’s internal model isn’t as surprised anymore. Remember that brain changes are driven by violations of expectations.</li>\n<li>As we grow older, skill replaces flexibility.</li>\n<li>However, retaining the plasticity of a child isn’t always a good thing. If plasticity didn’t decline, we would remain as helpless as a child.</li>\n<li>We would also lose our memories because nothing would stick, and this is horrific.</li>\n<li>Fundamentally, who you are is the sum total of your memory.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-10-remember-when\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-10-remember-when\" aria-label=\"chapter 10 remember when permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 10: Remember When</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Ribot’s law</em>: the observation that older memories are more stable.</li>\n<li>The strangeness of this pattern of memory comes from it not matching how we believe other storage systems to work.</li>\n<li>E.g. History forgets the old, governments brag about their latest accomplishments, and computers can lose older memories just as easily as newer memories.</li>\n<li>One of the most important aspects of livewiring is the phenomenon of memory.</li>\n<li>When you learn a new fact, there are physical changes in the brain.</li>\n<li>Lashley’s rat-treat experiment showed that memory isn’t localized to any one spot, but that it’s distributed across the brain.</li>\n<li>The physical basis of memory is the changing of synaptic weights.</li>\n<li>The first problem facing brains is that they live long lives.</li>\n<li>The problem with this is that there’s a lot to learn but there’s limited memory capacity.</li>\n<li>While Hebbian learning is great for encoding memory, it continues to be great for encoding memory and will overwrite previously learned memories.</li>\n<li>This is also known as the stability/plasticity dilemma.</li>\n<li>Memories need to be protected, not against time, but against the invasion of other memories.</li>\n<li>Brains don’t suffer from this problem, which means that something more is happening to solve the stability/plasticity dilemma.</li>\n<li>The first solution is to prevent the entire system from changing at once. This is done with neuromodulators.</li>\n<li>The brain changes only when it needs to and where it needs to.</li>\n<li>The second solution is to move memories to another place for more permanent storage.</li>\n<li>In other words, parts of the brain teach other parts.</li>\n<li>E.g. The hippocampus teaching the cortex.</li>\n<li>Memories don’t stay where they’re first formed but get moved along.</li>\n<li>Review of patient H.M. and that the hippocampus is crucial for learning new facts but not critical for remembering facts that have been learned.</li>\n<li>It’s been proposed that the hippocampus must reactivate a memory trace multiple times to lock the memory into the cortex. It must consolidate the memory to gain stability.</li>\n<li>This is also why after learning something, it requires less conscious effort because the brain doesn’t have to form new pathways, it just replays the built ones. Automating a skill means to move it to a different part of the brain.</li>\n<li>However, this doesn’t fix the problem as now the cortex will start to become full.</li>\n<li>Synaptic changes may be the consequences of memory storage rather than the root mechanism.</li>\n<li>Although changes at individual synapses have received the most attention, there are many other possible ways to store activity-dependent changes.</li>\n<li>The third solution is to add new cellular material.</li>\n<li>Plasticity exists throughout the brain at every level: from genes to synapses to dendrites to neurons to neural pathways to brain areas to the entire brain.</li>\n<li>Neuroscience focuses on the synapse because its what we can most easily measure, just like a drunk looking for his keys under the streetlight.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reasons to believe that synapses aren’t the only things that change</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If learning only tuned the efficacies of existing synapses, we wouldn’t expect large changes in structure in the brain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>But we do see sizable changes in the brain such as in London taxi drivers and medical students.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If memories were simply retained in synaptic weights, we’d have no reason to expect the growth of new neurons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In fact, new neurons would scramble up the delicate synaptic pattern, thus losing memories.</li>\n<li>But we do see new neurons being formed in the hippocampus after learning a task.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alterations to the sugars and proteins around the DNA alter patterns of gene expression.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evidence indicates that experience modifies gene expression.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>With all of these possible parameters to modify, how does the brain modify anything without messing up?</li>\n<li>What are the principles that keep the system in check?</li>\n<li>The most important lens isn’t the biological parts, it’s the timescale that they operate on.</li>\n<li>Memory isn’t explainable in terms of the details of the mechanism, but instead on the tempo at which it lives.</li>\n<li>The brain’s pace layers range from fast biochemical cascades to slow changes in gene expression.</li>\n<li>Plastic changes are distributed over a spectrum of time, and aren’t simply stored as all-or-none changes.</li>\n<li>A skill you thought was gone is still present; it’s burned deep into the circuitry of the brain.</li>\n<li>Exceptionally useful programs get burned down all the way to the level of DNA and we call these instincts. This is memory on the level of species.</li>\n<li>Human brains don’t stored memories the way computers do (but it’s similar with the way caching works).</li>\n<li>In the pace layer model, slow layers provide a framework for the fast layers.</li>\n<li>New memories must fit into your current collection of memories and not the other way around.</li>\n<li>Memories beautify life, but only forgetting makes it bearable.</li>\n<li>Synesthesia might come from sticky plasticity where people have a reduced ability to modify an association once it has been set.</li>\n<li>E.g. Once an initial pairing between a letter and a color has been set, it sticks.</li>\n<li>Evidence for this comes from a group of people born between 1960s to 1980s where their synesthesia matches the Fisher-Price refrigerator magnet set.</li>\n<li>There are many kinds of memory and many subtypes of it.</li>\n<li>How does the brain learn both general rules and exceptions?</li>\n<li>E.g. Birds with feathers fly but ostriches with feathers can’t fly.</li>\n<li>The brain has different systems for different learning speeds.</li>\n<li>One guess is that the hippocampus is used for fast changes, to learn specifics, while the cortex is used for slow changes to learn rules.</li>\n<li>With this trick, the brain can do rapid learning from individual episodes, while running a slow extraction of statistics across experiences.</li>\n<li>The way memories degrade, with older memories having more stability, reveals the secret of different timescales of change.</li>\n<li>There are more modifiable parameters in the brain than just synapses.</li>\n<li>E.g. Channel types, channel distributions, phosphorylation states, biochemical cascades, spatial arrangement of enzymes, and gene expression.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-11-the-wolf-and-the-mars-rover\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-11-the-wolf-and-the-mars-rover\" aria-label=\"chapter 11 the wolf and the mars rover permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 11: The Wolf and the Mars Rover</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Why are we still building hardwired machines that end up being discarded?</li>\n<li>E.g.
