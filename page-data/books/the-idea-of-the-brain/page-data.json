We used to attribute emotions and feelings to the heart using words like heartbroken and heartfelt.</li>\n<li>This has applied across most cultures, not just Western culture.</li>\n<li>This is because heart-centered views match our everyday experience; the heart changes its rhythm at the same time as our feelings change.</li>\n<li>E.g. Anger, love, and fear all cause the heart to beat faster.</li>\n<li>People believed this idea because it made sense.</li>\n<li>The first recorded challenge to our heart-centered view occurred in ancient Greece at around 600 and 250 BCE.</li>\n<li>However, Aristotle dismissed the idea as there was no actual proof (at the time) of any link between thought and the brain.</li>\n<li>To Aristotle, this makes logical sense.</li>\n<li>The acceptance and permission to directly study human anatomy enabled us to make significant discoveries with regard to the brain and the nervous system, as the dissection of the human body was previously forbidden.</li>\n<li>The heart-centered view shows us how everyday experience and intuition can mislead us from the truth.</li>\n<li>One researcher, Galen, became certain that the brain was the center of thought and proved it with his experiments on pigs.</li>\n<li>E.g. Galen would expose the pig brain and when pressure was applied to a certain area, the pig would stop moving.</li>\n<li>For over 1200 years, ventricular localization was widely accepted. It’s the idea that mental functions are located in the brain’s three ventricle (open spaces).</li>\n<li>E.g. Sensation and imagination in the front ventricle, intellect and reason in the middle, and motion and memory in the back.</li>\n<li>Faith, not fact, was still the essence of knowledge and formed the framework of European intellectual life for a good part of history.</li>\n<li>Vesalius could understand the body because careful dissection can reveal structures such as bone, muscle, and blood vessel, which imply different functions.</li>\n<li>However, dissection of the brain leads to no obvious difference in its structure as it looks mostly uniform.</li>\n<li>Vesalius couldn’t find any qualitative difference between the structure of a human brain and that of other vertebrates.</li>\n<li>There was no single ‘brain-centric moment’ when thinkers realized that the brain, and not the heart, was the key organ.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-2-forces\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-2-forces\" aria-label=\"chapter 2 forces permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 2: Forces</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The shift in attitude was slow and complex;
