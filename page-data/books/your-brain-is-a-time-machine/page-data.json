In other words, it can maintain the same cycle with only a one percent change in start/end time.</li>\n<li>Review of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and its role as the master circadian clock.</li>\n<li>Lesion and transplant studies support the hypothesis that the SCN governs our circadian clock.</li>\n<li>Tracking and anticipating the light and temperature fluctuations caused by the rotation of the Earth is so important that almost all forms of life have circadian clocks.</li>\n<li>Many cells have their own private circadian rhythm that’s implemented by the concentration of proteins rising and falling in a period of approximately 24 hours.</li>\n<li>Why would bacteria care what time it is?</li>\n<li>One of the driving forces for the evolution of circadian clocks was the adaptive coordination of cellular functions with cycles of light and dark.</li>\n<li>It isn’t enough to have a clock, but the clock must also resonate with the cycle of the environment to provide an evolutionary advantage.</li>\n<li>A circadian clock is implemented using a negative feedback loop.</li>\n<li>DNA encodes for a protein and that protein stops the production of itself. This will oscillate at a cycle matching the circadian rhythm.</li>\n<li>All cells have this circadian clock but they’re synced using the SCN, the master circadian clock.</li>\n<li>But how does the SCN know the correct time?</li>\n<li>It uses signals from the environment such as light. There are special ganglion cells in your retina that specifically send the light level to the SCN that’s independent of sight.</li>\n<li>The coordination of circadian clocks within our body is critical to being healthy.</li>\n<li>E.g. The pancreas increases insulin production before a meal but if the timing is off, you become at risk for diabetes due to insulin not being synced with increases in blood sugar.</li>\n<li>Are different clocks used for different time scales? Or is it the same clock?</li>\n<li>Studies show that we have distinct circuits devoted to telling time across different scales.</li>\n<li>E.g. Lesions to the SCN don’t change our ability to time events on the scale of seconds.</li>\n<li>This also matches with our understanding of the mechanism behind the circadian clock, as the biochemistry of protein transcription is too slow for measuring seconds.</li>\n<li>The timing devices within our body and brain are unlike man-made clocks.</li>\n<li>The same watch can track seconds, minutes, and years, but organisms need multiple clocks to track each of these units of time.</li>\n<li>While the brain does track time, we don’t feel it like we feel the pain of subbing our foot.</li>\n<li>The brain has other means to judge the passage of time.</li>\n<li>Where does our subjective sense of time’s passage come from?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-4-the-sixth-sense\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-4-the-sixth-sense\" aria-label=\"chapter 4 the sixth sense permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 4: The Sixth Sense</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>During intense situations, our subjective sense of time can be radically changed.</li>\n<li>E.g. Things going into slow motion during a car accident or during an intense competition like a sports finale.</li>\n<li>People generally overestimate the duration of intense events, but this also happens for mundane events such as waiting in line at the grocery store.</li>\n<li>Our subjective sense of time is actually quite inaccurate.</li>\n<li>Boring activities can create a feeling of chronostasis.</li>\n<li><em>Chronostasis</em>: the sensation that time is standing still.</li>\n<li>Exciting or engaging events have the opposite effect where time seems to have vaporized.</li>\n<li>E.g.

If someone asks you to remind them in five minutes versus if someone left five minutes ago and someone else asks how long ago since they left.</li>\n<li>The brain uses different mechanisms for each type of timing.</li>\n<li>Prospective timing uses the brain’s stopwatch, retrospective timing uses the brain’s memories.</li>\n<li>E.g. “In general, a time filled with varied and interesting experiences seems short in passing, but long as we look back.” - William James</li>\n<li>Retrospectively judging time uses the number of events stored in memory as a judge or proxy for duration.</li>\n<li>The intimate relationship between memory and retrospective timing is illustrated by patients that can’t form new long-term memories.</li>\n<li>Those patients always live in the now, unable to escape into the past.</li>\n<li>While retrospective timing is dominated by memory, prospective timing is dominated by cognitive load.</li>\n<li>E.g. The more complex or challenging a task, the shorter the estimated time elapsed.</li>\n<li>The opposite can happen with retrospective timing, but the effect isn’t as strong.</li>\n<li>It’s as if when we shift our attention, some internal timer within our brain ticks faster.</li>\n<li>Humans report that time slows down under the influence of cannabis because the hypothetical internal clock is running fast.</li>\n<li>The scientific literature on the effect of drugs on time perception indicates that there’s no single neurotransmitter that controls our perception of time.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Possible causes of the slow-motion effect</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overclocking the brain. Probably not.</li>\n<li>Hypermemory. Some contribution.</li>\n<li>Metaillusion. Most probable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A subjective experience, whether color, sound, or the passage of time are, in essence, illusions.</li>\n<li>E.g. The pain of stubbing your toe is produced within the brain, yet amazingly, it isn’t perceived as occurring within the brain; rather, it’s projected out to the point in space where your toe happens to be.</li>\n<li>The illusion is unveiled by phantom-limb syndrome.</li>\n<li>Our normal sense of time is a mental construct, one that seems to have different speed settings.</li>\n<li>Just like how the brain can project the feeling of location of our limbs to different points in space, it seems to also be able to differentiate events as quickly or slowly.</li>\n<li>That is, our subjective experience of time as fast or slow may be dissociated from the rate the brain is processing information or the brain’s internal clock speed.</li>\n<li>Ultimately, our perception of the speed of time is a somewhat arbitrary setting on top of consciousness.</li>\n<li>E.g. The speed that people talk varies, why not their perception of time too.

It’s the difference between knowing and remembering.</li>\n<li>It’s often overlooked that semantic memory is absent of a time stamp, but episodic memory has one.</li>\n<li>So episodic memory has order (in the form of a timeline) while semantic memory doesn’t.</li>\n<li>Both episodic memory and mentally projecting ourselves into the future require semantic memory.</li>\n<li>It’d be difficult to simulate being on the beach without knowledge of how sand, water, and wind work.</li>\n<li>Semantic memories may serve as the infrastructure to lay down episodic memories, which is supported by developmental studies.</li>\n<li>Lesion studies support the theory that mentally traveling backwards or forwards in time relies, in part, on the same cognitive capacities we use to store and reconstruct autobiographical information about the past, namely the hippocampus.</li>\n<li>Do other animals also mentally time travel?</li>\n<li>Telling time isn’t the same as thinking about the future.</li>\n<li>Most examples of apparent long-term planning in animals actually seem to be hardwired instincts.</li>\n<li>E.g. A falling rock doesn’t know the law of gravity much like a squirrel stashing nuts doesn’t know about winter.</li>\n<li>However, corvids and great apes seem to display foresight, which suggests that they do perform mental time travel.

Colors, hallucinations, dreams, infrared light, our retina’s blind spot.</li>\n<li>The feeling of the passage of time, our perception of change, is also a mental construct.</li>\n<li>Our brains don’t provide a linear progression or play-by-play account of the raw sensory events unfolding in our world.</li>\n<li>E.g. When you listen to speech, you don’t hear the syllables and air compression waves, you hear words and their meaning.</li>\n<li>Vision is partially suppressed during saccades and blinks, providing the illusion of the flow of time.</li>\n<li>The difference in speed of lightening and thunder, due to the difference in speed of light and sound, shows how the brain merges both sensory modalities to create a uniform perception.</li>\n<li>E.g. We don’t first see someone talking and then hear it, we experience it simultaneously even though light is faster than sound.</li>\n<li>We don’t consciously register the delay between visual and auditory signals because the unconscious brain integrates visual and auditory information into a single unified percept.</li>\n<li>The time span during this integration is called the temporal window of integration.</li>\n<li>Within this window, the brain considers the auditory and visual events to be simultaneous.</li>\n<li>E.g. Speech has a temporal window of 100 ms but the window is asymmetric. If the sound comes 50 ms before sight, we notice. If it comes after, we don’t.</li>\n<li>The temporal window isn’t set in stone and can adapt to the incoming data.</li>\n<li>The most compelling case of how consciousness reflects a temporally edited account of reality is that later sensory events can actually alter earlier ones.</li>\n<li>E.g. <em>Cutaneous rabbit illusion</em>: where two taps to the wrist and two taps to the elbow within 100 ms results in feeling four taps hopping along your arm instead of the predicted two taps to each location.</li>\n<li>The location of later stimuli alters your conscious perception of the location of the earlier ones.</li>\n<li>So, consciousness can’t be a uniform and continuous account of the flow of time.</li>\n<li>Review of the neural correlates of consciousness.</li>\n<li>“Not only do we consciously perceive only a very small portion of the sensory signals that we receive, but we do so with a time lag of 300 ms.” - Stanislas Dehaene</li>\n<li>When we hear ambiguous stimuli, the unconscious brain presumably waits for an unambiguous interpretation before crafting a conscious precept.</li>\n<li>E.g. The top stopped spinning versus The top of the mountain. The brain initiates both meanings of the word “top” before the sentence ends, and then selects the one that best matches the context.</li>\n<li>Maybe free will is just a feeling.</li>\n<li>Maybe the feeling of free will provides the conviction that we’re in control of our destiny, and thus the impetus to take charge and make the long-term, future-oriented, actions necessary for survival.</li>\n<li>There’s no unified consensus about the nature of time.</li>\n<li>Presumably, some functions the brain performs generate subjective experiences because consciousness affords a selective advantage to these processes.</li>\n<li>So what selective advantage does the subjective experience of time provide?</li>\n<li>If we’re to unwisely summarize the function of the brain in three words: anticipate the future.</li>\n<li>The brain tells time, remembers, and can imagine to predict and prepare for the future.</li>\n<li>The brain has a variety of mechanisms to tell time across different scales.</li>\n<li>Why are the clocks within the human brain so different from those devised by the human brain?</li>\n<li>The answer comes down to the building blocks of both types of clocks; one is built on biological systems, the other is built on physical systems.</li>\n</ul>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/CR4-DL/books/your-brain-is-a-time-machine/#part-i-brain-time\">Part I: Brain Time</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/books/your-brain-is-a-time-machine/#chapter-1-flavors-of-time\">Chapter 1: Flavors of Time</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/books/your-brain-is-a-time-machine/#chapter2-the-best-time-machine-youll-ever-own\">Chapter2: The Best Time Machine You’ll Ever Own</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/books/your-brain-is-a-time-machine/#chapter-3-day-and-night\">Chapter 3: Day and Night</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/books/your-brain-is-a-time-machine/#chapter-4-the-sixth-sense\">Chapter 4: The Sixth Sense</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/books/your-brain-is-a-time-machine/#chapter-5-patterns-in-time\">Chapter 5: Patterns in Time</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/books/your-brain-is-a-time-machine/#chapter-6-time-neural-dynamics-and-chaos\">Chapter 6: Time, Neural Dynamics, and Chaos</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/CR4-DL/books/your-brain-is-a-time-machine/#part-ii-the-physical-and-mental-nature-of-time\">Part II: The Physical and Mental Nature of Time</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/books/your-brain-is-a-time-machine/#chapter-7-keeping-time\">Chapter 7: Keeping Time</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/books/your-brain-is-a-time-machine/#chapter-8-time-what-the-hell-is-it\">Chapter 8: Time: What the Hell Is It?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/books/your-brain-is-a-time-machine/#chapter-9-the-spatialization-of-time-in-physics\">Chapter 9: The Spatialization of Time in Physics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/books/your-brain-is-a-time-machine/#chapter-10-the-spatialization-of-time-in-neuroscience\">Chapter 10: The Spatialization of Time in Neuroscience</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/books/your-brain-is-a-time-machine/#chapter-11-mental-time-travel\">Chapter 11: Mental Time Travel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/CR4-DL/books/your-brain-is-a-time-machine/#chapter-12-consciousness-binding-the-past-and-the-future\">Chapter 12: Consciousness: Binding the Past and the Future</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":26,"frontmatter":{"title":"Your Brain Is a Time Machine","date":"May 30, 2021","book_authors":"Dean Buonomano","categories":["Books"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/your-brain-is-a-time-machine/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/papers/neuroscience-set-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Neuroscience Papers Set 2","layout":"post"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/papers/neuroscience-set-3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Neuroscience Papers Set 3","layout":"post"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1031357278","1878747374","3666494887"]}
